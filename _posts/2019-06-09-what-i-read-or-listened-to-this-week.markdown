Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Canadian Conservatives Are Having a Bad Time at the Online Hate Hearings](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ywyqbw/canadian-conservatives-are-having-a-bad-time-at-the-online-hate-hearings)

* [I left the ad industry because our use of data tracking terrified me](https://www.fastcompany.com/90359992/an-ad-tech-pioneer-on-where-our-data-economy-went-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it) - "I realized that my industry had changed. Advertising had ceased to be about connecting with consumers—it was now about finding novel ways of extracting evermore personal information from computers, phones, and smart homes. To many of the most powerful and profitable companies in the world, we are the products, and the services we all use are just afterthoughts they put out to keep us hooked. And the rest of the ad industry, which depends on their data to compete, has no choice but to go along with whatever whims and changes come their way."

* [The Making of a YouTube Radical](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html) - "In reality, YouTube has been a godsend for hyper-partisans on all sides. It has allowed them to bypass traditional gatekeepers and broadcast their views to mainstream audiences, and has helped once-obscure commentators build lucrative media businesses."

* [Schools Are Deploying Massive Digital Surveillance Systems. The Results Are Alarming](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2019/05/30/schools-are-deploying-massive-digital-surveillance-systems.html) - "If students know that administrators and parents are going to be alerted when they discuss self-harm or suicide with friends, for example, might that actually deter them from seeking help?"

* [On YouTube’s Digital Playground, an Open Gate for Pedophiles](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/world/americas/youtube-pedophiles.html)
