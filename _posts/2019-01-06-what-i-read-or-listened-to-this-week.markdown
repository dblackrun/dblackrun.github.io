Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The 30-Year Mortgage is an Intrinsically Toxic Product](https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/the-30-year-mortgage-is-an-intrinsically-toxic-product-200c901746a) - "A realistic summary of the American housing finance ecosystem is that most of it has been socialized: while we spend some money on public housing for the poor, we invest vastly more in hybrid public-private housing for the middle class; the capitalist part is what happens if your house goes up in price, and the socialist part is what happens if it doesn’t."

* [Facebook Knows How to Track You Using the Dust on Your Camera Lens](https://gizmodo.com/facebook-knows-how-to-track-you-using-the-dust-on-your-1821030620) - "With that kind of thinking happening internally at Facebook, it’s hard not to start thinking of it more as a spy service than a social network. If these techniques were put into practice, it would be an incredibly invasive level of tracking in service of suggesting you connect with people that you may not actually want Facebook to know that you know."

* [Privacy and Cybersecurity Are Converging. Here’s Why That Matters for People and for Companies.](https://hbr.org/2019/01/privacy-and-cybersecurity-are-converging-heres-why-that-matters-for-people-and-for-companies)
