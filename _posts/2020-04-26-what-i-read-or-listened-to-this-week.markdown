Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Stones, Clocks, and What We Should Actually Leave Behind](https://www.wired.com/story/stones-clocks-what-we-should-actually-leave-behind/)

* [Calling Me a Hero Only Makes You Feel Better](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/i-work-grocery-store-dont-call-me-hero/610147/) - "Cashiers and shelf-stockers and delivery-truck drivers aren’t heroes. They’re victims. To call them heroes is to justify their exploitation. By praising the blue-collar worker’s public service, the progressive consumer is assuaged of her cognitive dissonance. When the world isn’t falling apart, we know the view of us is usually as faceless, throwaway citizens. The wealthy CEO telling his thousands of employees that they are vital, brave, and noble is a manipulative strategy to keep them churning out profits."

* [Through No Fault of Their Own](https://www.epsilontheory.com/through-no-fault-of-their-own/)

* [When in Doubt: Hang Up, Look Up, & Call Back](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/when-in-doubt-hang-up-look-up-call-back/)

* [North of the Color Line](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807871669/north-of-the-color-line/) - Some history on racial segregation and civil rights activism in Canada in the late 1800s and early to mid 1900s.
