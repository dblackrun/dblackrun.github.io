Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [News Brief: Cops Push “Outside Agitator” Line, Exploit Real Fears of Far Right Violence to Delegitimize Protests](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/news-brief-cops-push-outside-agitator-line-exploit-real-fears-of-far-right-violence-to-delegitimize-protests)

* [Corporations tweet support for Black Lives Matter. Their FEC filings tell a different story.](https://popular.info/p/corporations-tweet-support-for-black)

* [The activist dismantling racist police algorithms](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/05/1002709/the-activist-dismantling-racist-police-algorithms) - "Algorithms have no place in policing. I think it’s crucial that we understand that there are lives at stake. This language of location-based policing is by itself a proxy for racism. They’re not there to police potholes and trees. They are there to police people in the location. So location gets criminalized, people get criminalized, and it’s only a few seconds away before the gun comes out and somebody gets shot and killed."
