Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Shift: The Next Evolution in Baseball Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Shift-Next-Evolution-Baseball-Thinking/dp/1629375446/) - Good read on thinking about baseball strategy while also remembering the players are human. For example, when measuring the impact of a manager, just being able to keep your team motivated and focused each day during the regular season grind is probably more valuable than all the bullpen usage decisions you make all season.

* [The Economist asks: Can one whistleblower tame the tech titans?](https://www.acast.com/theeconomistasks/theeconomistasks-canonewhistleblowertamethetechtitans-) - Interview with the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower on data privacy.

* [Open science is now the only way forward for psychology](https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2018/aug/23/open-science-is-now-the-only-way-forward-for-psychology) - An overview of some of the recent improvements in psychology research.

* [Online Bettors Can Sniff Out Weak Psychology Studies](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/scientists-can-collectively-sense-which-psychology-studies-are-weak/568630/) - "Beyond statistical issues, it strikes me that several of the studies that didn’t replicate have another quality in common: newsworthiness. They reported cute, attention-grabbing, whoa-if-true results that conform to the biases of at least some parts of society."

* [Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X/) - An in depth look at the lies and unethical behaviour of Tharanos. It's one of those stories that you look back on and wonder how so many reputable people got caught up in it given that they were never able to do anything close to what they claimed and none of the investors specialized in healthcare.

* [For NFL players, one daunting question looms ‘Now that I’m here, what do I do next?’](https://theundefeated.com/features/former-nfl-player-domonique-foxworth-big-questions-after-end-of-career/)
