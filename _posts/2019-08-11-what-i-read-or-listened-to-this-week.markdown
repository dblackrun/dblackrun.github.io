Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [How Much Traffic Do Uber and Lyft Cause?](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/08/uber-lyft-traffic-congestion-ride-hailing-cities-drivers-vmt/595393/)

* [Free Speech Is Not the Same As Free Reach](https://www.wired.com/story/free-speech-is-not-the-same-as-free-reach/) - "That said, unconscious bias is a concern in any algorithm; this is why tech companies have investigated conservative claims of bias since the Facebook Trending News debacle of 2016. There hasn’t been any credible evidence. But there is a trust problem, and a lack of understanding of how rankings and feeds work, and that allows bad-faith politicking to gain traction. The best solution to that is to increase transparency and internet literacy, enabling users to have a better understanding of why they see what they see—and to build these powerful curatorial systems with a sense of responsibility for what they return."

* [Why We Hate Taxes, and Why Some People Want Us To](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-we-hate-taxes-and-why-some-people-want-us-to/) - "In short, social science research tells us that at least part of our tax aversion stems from the opacity of government processes and the pernicious effect of sludges in the way we file taxes in the United States. To make matters worse, there are powerful special interest groups who are keen to keep the system opaque and sludgy. "
