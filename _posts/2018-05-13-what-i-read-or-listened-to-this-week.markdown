Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Learning Is a Learned Behavior. Here’s How to Get Better at It.](https://hbr.org/2018/05/learning-is-a-learned-behavior-heres-how-to-get-better-at-it) - Learning how to learn helps you get better at learning new things. Setting specific targets, stopping to think if you really understand something and reflecting on what you have learned are all things you can do to help improve your ability to learn.

* [Can the Placebo Effect Enhance Athletic Performance?](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/health-fitness/exercise/can-the-placebo-effect-enhance-athletic-performance) - Yes it can, and we don't know why, "it could be reduced anxiety that leads to lower muscle tension which makes the body move more efficient and fluid. Or it could be a reduction in perceived exertion and even pain. Or taking a placebo may simply plant a subliminal thought that motivates you to push yourself harder."

* [Data Violence and How Bad Engineering Choices Can Damage Society](https://medium.com/s/story/data-violence-and-how-bad-engineering-choices-can-damage-society-39e44150e1d4) - Building a model using biased data will result in a model that reinforces those biases. It is important to ask who is hurt by the assumptions used to build the model.

* [To Work Better, Work Less](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/to-work-better-work-less/375763/) - Working more efficiently in fewer hours leads to a healthier, more balanced life.

* [Inside The Ecosystem That Fuels Amazon’s Fake Review Problem](https://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolenguyen/amazon-fake-review-problem) - A fascinating look at the fake review ecosystem on Amazon.

* [Having Your Smartphone Nearby Takes a Toll on Your Thinking](https://hbr.org/2018/03/having-your-smartphone-nearby-takes-a-toll-on-your-thinking) - Just having your smartphone nearby has a similar effect on cognitive capacity as lack of sleep.

* [Poker Life Podcast - Maria Konnikova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegMJe62jYA) - Interview with Maria Konnikova on her poker journey. She started out writing a book about learning to play and has had enough success to delay finishing the book. Lots of good insight on the learning process and the poker skills that are transferable to life.
