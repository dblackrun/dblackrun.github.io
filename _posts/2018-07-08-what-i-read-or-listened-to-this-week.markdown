Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Unintelligence-Computers-Misunderstand-World/dp/0262038005/) - A great book on the limits of artificial intelligence/machine learning. Computers are great for simple, boring tasks but as the problem gets more complex issues can pop up.

* [The Marshmallow Replication - You Are Not So Smart Podcast](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2018/07/02/yanss-131-the-psychological-forces-that-make-waiting-for-marshmallows-easier-also-make-life-itself-easier/) - The marshmallow test is one of the most famous psychological studies. A replication of the study shows the lesson, that children who can wait were more likely to be successful as adults, may have been overstated. "An expanded replication shows the ability to delay gratification at 4-years old isn’t nearly as strong a predictor of later success as socio-economic status. In fact, it was socio-economic status all along that affected children’s ability to wait for the marshmallow."

* [Freeing Econ 101: Beyond the Grasp of the Invisible Hand](http://behavioralscientist.org/freeing-econ-101-beyond-the-grasp-of-the-invisible-hand/) - As someone with an economics degree who thought a lot of the models that were taught weren't very useful, I like what David Laibson is doing. Had I been exposed to behavioural economics and where Econ 101 theories go wrong while in school, I may have gotten more out of my university classes.

* [The rise of 'pseudo-AI': how tech firms quietly use humans to do bots' work](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/06/artificial-intelligence-ai-humans-bots-tech-companies)

* [Future Projection with Tim O’Reilly](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/07/06/future-projection-with-tim-oreilly/)

* [Why it’s not your fault it’s so hard to understand investing](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/article-why-its-not-your-fault-its-so-hard-to-understand-investing/) - The investment industry likes to make it seem like what they are doing is complicated on they are the only ones capable of doing it.
