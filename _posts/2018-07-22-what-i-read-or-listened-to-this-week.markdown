Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144324/) - I knew sleep was important but this book opened my eyes to just how important it is to get 8 hours of sleep each night. Decades of studies are cited detailing how a lack of sleep hurts your short and long term health as well as memory and decision making abilities.

* [YANSS Podcast 030 – How practice changes the brain and exceptions to the 10,000 hour rule with David Epstein](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2014/08/14/yanss-podcast-030-how-practice-changes-the-brain-with-david-epstein/)

* [Forget The Gadgets and Hacks: Nail The Basics](https://www.scienceofrunning.com/2016/12/forget-the-gadgets-and-hacks-nail-the-basics.html?v=3e8d115eb4b3) - Focusing on the little things before you have mastered the big things is an inefficient way to get better.

* [The Most Common Vulnerability Of All](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-most-common-vulnerability-of-all-a9131a454585) - Good overview of the security issues associated with email along with some solutions.

* [Stop Playing Devil’s Advocate, and Other Advice for Better Decision Making](http://behavioralscientist.org/stop-playing-devils-advocate-and-other-advice-for-better-decision-making/)
