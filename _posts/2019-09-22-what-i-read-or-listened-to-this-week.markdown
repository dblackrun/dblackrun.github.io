Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [What College Admissions Offices Really Want](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/10/magazine/college-admissions-paul-tough.html) - Meritocracy is a myth in so many areas.

* [The Internet of Things Is Still a Privacy Dumpster Fire, Study Finds](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyzjym/the-internet-of-things-is-still-a-privacy-dumpster-fire-study-finds) - Smart home devices are a privacy nightmare.

* [To Change a Habit, Get Extreme. Progressively](https://behavioralscientist.org/to-change-a-habit-get-extreme-progressively/)
