Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [What We Can Learn About Online Privacy From Climate Change](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/technology/online-privacy-climate-change.html)

* [How Much of the Internet Is Fake? Turns Out, a Lot of It, Actually.](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html)

* [How a Dubious Forensic Science Spread Like a Virus](https://features.propublica.org/blood-spatter-analysis/herbert-macdonell-forensic-evidence-judges-and-courts/) - Crazy how something with so little scientific backing became commonplace in courts. "The paper showed that the hypotheses that underpin bloodstain-pattern analysis remained largely untested. And, it said, analysts’ assumptions and errors could make their conclusions rife with uncertainty. Analysts failed to properly account for gravity when using bloodstains to calculate victims’ locations. They assumed things about how speed influences blood patterns that had never been scientifically proven."
