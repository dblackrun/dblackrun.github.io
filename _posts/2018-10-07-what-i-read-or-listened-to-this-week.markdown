Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S. Companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies?srnd=businessweek-v2)

* [What Happened to the Houston Astros' Hacker?](https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/10/04/chris-correa-houston-astros-hacker-former-cardinals-scouting-director-exclusive-interview)

* [Fake Toughness Versus the Real Thing](https://www.peakperformancebook.net/single-post/2018/10/03/Letting-It-Happen-Versus-Making-It-Happen)

* [Why Employers Should Stop Giving Away Snacks](https://psmag.com/economics/why-employers-should-stop-giving-away-snacks) - "This policy is also unfair. If you have two employees who each earn the same salary, the one that consumes more free food will be effectively getting paid more. Free snacks are, in effect, a redistribution of wealth from the health conscious to the gluttonous."
