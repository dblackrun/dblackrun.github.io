Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [How to Save Investors From Themselves](http://behavioralscientist.org/how-to-save-investors-from-themselves/)

* [Why businesses fail at machine learning](https://hackernoon.com/why-businesses-fail-at-machine-learning-fbff41c4d5db)

* [Facebook Won’t Make the Bed It Lies In](https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/facebook-wont-ban-infowars-heres-the-real-reason-thats-a-problem.html) - Same thing applies to YouTube.

* [The Downsides of America’s Hyper-Competitive Youth-Soccer Industry](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/07/the-downsides-of-americas-hyper-competitive-youth-soccer-industry/565109/) - I'd imagine there are similar issues with other sports and early specialization. If I was a kid today I don't think I would enjoy playing sports near as much as I did growing up.
