Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The best defense against deepfake AI might be . . . blinking](https://www.fastcompany.com/90230076/the-best-defense-against-deepfakes-ai-might-be-blinking) - "Healthy adult humans blink somewhere between every 2 and 10 seconds, and a single blink takes between one-tenth and four-tenths of a second. That’s what would be normal to see in a video of a person talking. But it’s not what happens in many deepfake videos."

* [The Great Divide in How Americans Commute to Work](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/01/commuting-to-work-data-car-public-transit-bike/580507/)

* [Big Telecom Sold Highly Sensitive Customer GPS Data Typically Used for 911 Calls](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3b3dg/big-telecom-sold-customer-gps-data-911-calls)

* [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718/)
