Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [4 Reasons Why News Media Will Thrive In The Wake Of Privacy Regulation](https://adexchanger.com/the-sell-sider/4-reasons-why-news-media-will-thrive-in-the-wake-of-privacy-regulation/)

* [Ready to destroy a longstanding argument against raising the minimum wage?](https://qz.com/work/1696971/why-we-can-raise-the-us-minimum-wage-without-destroying-jobs/) - "Now imagine you have job offers from two companies. One is much closer to your home than the other, and you value a short commute.  The first company therefore can pay you a lower salary because of that differential. But there are other people who live closer to the second company, so that company can also pay workers a lower salary. In the end, they will probably both offer a lower wage. Because there is always somebody with different preferences than you, it means both companies will ultimately pay workers less than what they would pay in a competitive market."

* [I’m the Best Data Scientist You’d Never Hire](https://medium.com/@aawinecoff/im-the-best-data-scientist-you-d-never-hire-700b751a3b2e) - "I will say that just as many tech companies advertise a desire to attract diverse talent, they simultaneously undermine their own diversity efforts by designing hiring processes that require people with different backgrounds to meet a higher standard. Not only must we demonstrate the utility of our unique skillsets, but we also must demonstrate that we have acceptable expertise in the areas in which “traditional” applicants shine brightest. Put bluntly, no matter how good we are at other things, we still have to clear The White Guy Bar."

* [The Spy Who Came Home](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/07/the-spy-who-came-home)
