Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Real Problem With Baseball](http://joeposnanski.com/the-real-problem-with-baseball/) - "It’s a huge error that companies make all the time — they mistake nostalgia for a business model." As a casual baseball fan, I can relate to a lot of stuff in here. I find it hard to find a baseball game on TV where the commentators don't complain about the current state of the game and only mention outdated stats in their analysis. It's hard to grow the game when the people on TV who are in a position to promote the game don't seem to enjoy the game themselves. There are plenty of people capable of talking about baseball in a way that would get me to watch more games, none of them are working as television analysts outside of Sunday Night Baseball.

* [Decision-Making Should Be a Required Course in Every High School](https://medium.com/s/story/farsighted-decision-making-should-be-a-required-course-in-every-high-school-6b5a836c1e1e) - I agree with the sentiment that decision making is a very important skill, but I think a course like this would really require a great teacher to make it worthwhile.

* [The European Union Versus the Internet](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-european-union-versus-the-internet/) - "Much like the Copyright Directive, the GDPR is targeted at Google and Facebook, but as is always the case when you fundamentally misunderstand what you are fighting, the net effect is to in fact strengthen their moats. After all, who is better equipped to navigate complex regulation than the biggest companies of all, and who needs less outside data than those that collect the most?" "For Facebook, the Cambridge Analytica scandal was akin to the Surgeon General’s report on smoking: the threat was not that regulators would act, but that users would, and nothing could be more fatal."

* [Privacy vs. OSINT with Justin Seitz](https://soundcloud.com/user-98066669/091-privacy-vs-osint-with-justin-seitz) - The Complete Privacy & Security Podcast interview with Justin Seitz on the impacts on OSINT on privacy. Good stuff if you have any interest in privacy online.
