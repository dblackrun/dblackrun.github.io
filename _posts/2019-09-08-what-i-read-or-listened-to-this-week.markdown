Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Sports Gene](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/309105/the-sports-gene-by-david-epstein/9781617230127)

* [Everything I googled in a week as a professional software engineer](https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/)

* [“Teddies for Timor” and the Perils of Good Intentions](https://behavioralscientist.org/teddies-for-timor-and-the-perils-of-good-intentions/) - "Despite numerous campaigns asking for cash instead, people persist in giving goods. These block the arrival of vital supplies, often end up in landfills, and cost millions of dollars to store and dispose of—ironically negatively impacting life-saving efforts."
