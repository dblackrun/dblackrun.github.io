Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Say No to the “Cashless Future” — and to Cashless Stores](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/consumer-privacy/say-no-cashless-future-and-cashless-stores)

* [How a 'NULL' License Plate Landed One Hacker in Ticket Hell](https://www.wired.com/story/null-license-plate-landed-one-hacker-ticket-hell/) - "The ‘minimum viable product’ concept has pushed a lot of bad code through that doesn’t go through with the proper level of testing"

* [How MLS Gets Politics so Wrong](https://fiftyfive.one/2019/08/how-mls-gets-politics-so-wrong/) - "MLS’s attempt to deny political discussion during soccer games is an inherently political act. Whether acknowledged or not, the political is already there. The threats of hate and violence exist whether someone brings a sign that says “Refugees Welcome” to a game or not. The refugees are already in the stadium; they’re already playing pick-up in the park; they’re already being threatened, deported en masse, and murdered. The only question is: will you explicitly counter this? Or will you ask the dinner table not to discuss such unpleasant topics?"

* [Jay-Z goes to the NFL](https://theundefeated.com/features/jay-z-goes-to-the-nfl/) - "Jay-Z and Ross are trying to play both sides. Each wants the world to know he may be an apex predator capitalist, but, beneath the cold cynicism that made each rich, there’s a heart of gold and he wants to fix the wrongs of the world. I mean, it’s possible that’s true. But few become billionaires by being good. Helping uninvested parties isn’t as lucrative as hurting them."

* [Watch a Drone Take Over a Nearby Smart TV](https://www.wired.com/story/smart-tv-drone-hack/)
