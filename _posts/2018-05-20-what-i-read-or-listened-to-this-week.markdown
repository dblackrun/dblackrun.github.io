Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Debiasing the corporation: An interview with Nobel laureate Richard Thaler](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/debiasing-the-corporation-an-interview-with-nobel-laureate-richard-thaler) - Interview with Richard Thaler on how to combat biases to make better decisions. Key items include writing stuff down to keep a record of the thought process that led to a decision and welcoming opposing view points to avoid making mistakes you would have never considered.

* [Why the Luddites Matter](https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/) - "The Luddites were not “anti-technology.” They were skilled craft workers who believed that the new machinery being deployed by factory owners would impoverish, disempower, and immiserate them. They were right. They didn’t want “zero technology,” they wanted to feed their families. If they had their way we wouldn’t be living in a world with “no technology,” we’d be living in a world where communities have a say in the technological decisions that will impact them."

* [Surest Way to Face Marijuana Charges in New York: Be Black or Hispanic](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-arrests-nyc-race.html) - Analysis of the racial biases in policing in NYC.

* [Bomani Jones Has a Funny Joke for You](https://www.gq.com/story/bomani-jones-new-espn-show-profile) - I'm not sure there is anyone in sports media smarter than Bomani Jones.

* [The Case Against Education](https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652) - A well researched book on the value of education. The main arguments are that education is mostly signaling and most of what is taught in school isn't useful outside of school. Selfishly people should pursue higher education, but when everyone does this it creates credential inflation and there isn't much societal value in mass education under the current system. I found the pace of the book to be pretty slow at times.

* [Let’s Not Forget How Wrong Our Crime Data Are](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-17/let-s-not-forget-how-wrong-our-crime-data-are)

* [Lessons from My Math Degree That Have Nothing to Do with Math](https://medium.com/s/story/6-life-lessons-from-my-math-degree-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-math-d38aba90edfe)

* ['I felt exposed online': how to disappear from the internet](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/19/exposed-how-to-disappear-from-the-internet)
