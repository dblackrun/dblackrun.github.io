Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [It's time to maintain](https://vicki.substack.com/p/its-time-to-maintain)

* [Epistemic Humility—Knowing Your Limits in a Pandemic](https://behavioralscientist.org/epistemic-humility-coronavirus-knowing-your-limits-in-a-pandemic/) - "If you want to reduce overconfidence in yourself or others, just ask: What are the reasons to think this claim may be mistaken? Under what conditions would this be wrong?"

* [Research reveals the scope of Google’s digital ecosystem dominance](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2020/05/27/research-reveals-the-scope-of-googles-digital-ecosystem-dominance/) - "Earlier this year, Google announced plans to retire the third-party “cookie.” The cookies websites place on a user’s browser to identify each unique user. This enables intermediaries in the ad stack to track consumers as they visit different sites. Google doesn’t rely on cookies in order to place targeted ads and track attribution. Its sites, aps, and devices collect user data. Google has no problem identifying users for targeting practices with or without the cookie. However, retiring the cookie has direct and negative implications for others in the ad stack."
