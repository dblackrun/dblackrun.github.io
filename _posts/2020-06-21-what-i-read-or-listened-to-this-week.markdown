Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Episode 111: How “Small Business” Rhetoric Is Used to Protect Corporate America](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-111-how-small-business-rhetoric-is-used-to-protect-corporate-america)

* [The Economy Is Reeling. The Tech Giants Spy Opportunity.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/technology/facebook-amazon-apple-google-microsoft-tech-pandemic-opportunity.html)

* [The Allure of Simplicity](https://polimath.substack.com/p/the-allure-of-simplicity) - "Anyone who says they can explain what is going on with one single insight or in a single tweet thread or in a 2 minute “here’s one weird metric that explains everything”, that person is wrong. That kind of thinking should send a siren off in your head that the person who is saying this has a shallow grounding in the very complex world we live in. That they could actually think it is possible to figure out The Answer to all the data patterns that we see indicates to us that they haven’t thought very hard about all the metrics and how they interact with each other."

* [Murder exposes Facebook's Boogaloo problem](https://popular.info/p/murder-exposes-facebooks-boogaloo)
