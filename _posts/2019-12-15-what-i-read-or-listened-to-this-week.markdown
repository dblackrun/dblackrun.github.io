Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Episode 10: Making the Grade](https://www.happinesslab.fm/episodes/making-the-grade)

* [Biased Algorithms Are Easier to Fix Than Biased People](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/business/algorithm-bias-fix.html)

* [Makers and Takers How Wall Street Destroyed Main Street](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247738/makers-and-takers-by-rana-foroohar/)

* [“Further Exploration Needed in Women”—the Hidden Sexism in Scientific Research](https://behavioralscientist.org/the-results-need-to-be-further-explored-in-women-the-hidden-sexism-in-scientific-research/) - "The inclusion of females in research—and done in such a way that accounts for cyclically changing hormones—is not something that should be left up to the goodwill of the researchers running the studies.  When science is done this way, women and women’s issues lose. There is so much pressure put on scientists to publish, publish, publish, that many (and I have been as guilty of this as anyone else) choose to do what’s fast, cheap, and easy, rather than do what’s right."
