Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Facebook Approved Ads With Coronavirus Misinformation](https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/facebook-approved-ads-with-coronavirus-misinformation/)

* [Keep the Parks Open](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/closing-parks-ineffective-pandemic-theater/609580/) - "The outdoors and sunshine are such strong factors in fighting viral infections that a 2009 study of the extraordinary success of outdoor hospitals during the 1918 influenza epidemic suggested that during the next pandemic (I guess this one!) we should encourage “the public to spend as much time outdoors as possible,” as a public-health measure."

* [Privacy Cannot Be a Casualty of the Coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/digital-privacy-coronavirus.html)

* [165-What Amazon & Twitter Knows About You (and Me)](https://soundcloud.com/user-98066669/165-what-amazon-twitter-knows-about-you-and-me)

* [Capitalists or Cronyists?](https://www.profgalloway.com/capitalists-or-cronyists) - "A pillar of capitalism is you can’t reward the winners without punishing the losers. I worry our government has been co-opted by the wealthy and is focused on protecting the previous generation of winners, even if it means reducing future generations’ ability to win. Aren’t we borrowing against our children’s prosperity to protect the wealth of the top 10, if not 1, percent?"
