Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Altruism Still Fuels the Web. Businesses Love to Exploit It](https://www.wired.com/story/altruism-open-source-fuels-web-businesses-love-to-exploit-it)

* [We've Reached Peak Wellness. Most of It Is Nonsense.](https://www.outsideonline.com/2399826/wellness-industry-lies-what-really-works)

* [The Adults In The Room](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/the-adults-in-the-room-1837487584) - "The numbers apparently do not matter to my ostensibly numbers-obsessed bosses, for reasons I can’t quite understand. When I have told them that the data show that non-sports content brings more traffic and more revenue opportunities, I have been ignored. When I have told them that the data show that readers prefer publications with a distinctive point of view, that Deadspin succeeds precisely because it doesn’t try to be all things to all people, I have been told that being all things to all people is in fact exactly the way to grow pageviews. The reason my colleagues are not going to suddenly start sticking to sports is not about editorial purity, it’s about the opportunity to grow the audience and make more money for Great Hill Partners. But the adults in the room know that we’re wrong, despite all evidence, because they just know."

* [The Internet Has Made Dupes—and Cynics—of Us All](https://www.wired.com/story/internet-made-dupes-cynics-of-us-all/)

* [I Visited 47 Sites. Hundreds of Trackers Followed Me.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html) - "Google was present on every site I visited, collecting information on where I live, the device I used and everything I looked at."
