Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Why Won’t Twitter Treat White Supremacy Like ISIS? Because It Would Mean Banning Some Republican Politicians Too.](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3xgq5/why-wont-twitter-treat-white-supremacy-like-isis-because-it-would-mean-banning-some-republican-politicians-too) - "We can frame this the opposite way, too: Filters designed to target ISIS overban, but mostly affect people without the political leverage to make this awkward for the company." - https://twitter.com/normative/status/1121459735444762625

* [When it comes to Nikola Jokic, we’re all biased](https://www.denverstiffs.com/2019/4/27/18516702/when-it-comes-to-nikola-jokic-were-all-biased) - I'm breaking my rule of not listing basketball content because the ideas in this article can be applied to pretty much anything.

* [The Black Feminists Who Saw the Alt-Right Threat Coming](https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/black-feminists-alt-right-twitter-gamergate.html)

* [Women Did Everything Right. Then Work Got ‘Greedy.’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/upshot/women-long-hours-greedy-professions.html) - "Just as more women earned degrees, the jobs that require those degrees started paying disproportionately more to people with round-the-clock availability. At the same time, more highly educated women began to marry men with similar educations, and to have children. But parents can be on call at work only if someone is on call at home. Usually, that person is the mother. "
