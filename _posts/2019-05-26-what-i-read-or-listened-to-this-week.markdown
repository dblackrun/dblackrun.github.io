Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [We Are Tenants on Our Own Devices](https://www.wired.com/story/right-to-repair-tenants-on-our-own-devices/) - "How long before other devices start behaving as spies and taskmasters in our own home? Will the coffee maker let us have that seventh cup that the doctor advised us against?"

* [Who will answer the Christchurch Call? Nobody, if tech platforms continue ungoverned](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-who-will-answer-the-christchurch-call-nobody-if-tech-platforms/) - "If we believe in the premise that society should be able to leverage public data for the public good, citizens should have far greater rights over the use, mobility and monetization of their data, and regulation must be matched with meaningful enforcement."

* [You Donâ€™t Want a Child Prodigy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/opinion/sunday/kids-sports-music-choices.html)
