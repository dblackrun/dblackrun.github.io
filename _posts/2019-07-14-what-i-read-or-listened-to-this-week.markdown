Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Digital Jail: How Electronic Monitoring Drives Defendants Into Debt](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/magazine/digital-jail-surveillance.html) - "Across the country, defendants who have not been convicted of a crime are put on “offender funded” payment plans for monitors that sometimes cost more than their bail. And unlike bail, they don’t get the payment back, even if they’re found innocent." Basically, people are being put in jail for being poor.

* [10 tips for reviewing code you don’t like](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/07/08/10-tips-for-reviewing-code-you-dont-like/) - These apply for anything you don't like, not just code reviews.

* [The Smart Enough City: Putting Technology in Its Place to Reclaim Our Urban Future](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Enough-City-Putting-Technology/dp/0262039672/) - "the smart city will be a place where self-driving cars strangle downtowns and debilitate public transportation, where democracy is reduced to sending picture of potholes with an app, where police use algorithms to justify and perpetuate racist practices, where governments and companies surveil public space to control behavior"
