Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Bias Inside: A Conversation With Psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt](https://behavioralscientist.org/the-bias-inside-a-conversation-with-psychologist-jennifer-eberhardt/)

* [What does it mean to be working class in Canada?](https://www.macleans.ca/society/what-does-it-mean-to-be-working-class-in-canada/) - "Put bluntly: if living the same life as your parents and everyone you grew up around is somehow a failure, how are you supposed to feel about that? How are they supposed to feel about that? How are they supposed to feel about you when you come back home for a visit?"

* [Other peopleâ€™s messes](https://blog.jessitron.com/2019/07/21/other-peoples-messes/)

* [Should Kids Learn to Code](https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1151905633920094208)
