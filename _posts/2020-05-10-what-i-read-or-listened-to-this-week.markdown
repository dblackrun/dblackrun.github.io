Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Memory Illusion](https://soundcloud.com/youarenotsosmart/180-the-memory-illusion) - This has scary consequences for things like false confessions and eyewitness testimony.

* [The Grim Conclusions of the Largest-Ever Study of Fake News](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/largest-study-ever-fake-news-mit-twitter/555104/)

* [Donâ€™t Close Parks. Open Up Streets.](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/open-the-streets/611470/)
