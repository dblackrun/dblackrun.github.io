Some notes and quotes from the books I have read this year:

* [The Meritocracy Trap](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/548174/the-meritocracy-trap-by-daniel-markovits/) - The meritocracy trap is basically a snowball effect in which middle class jobs get displaced by more highly skilled, higher paying jobs. Those with the higher paying jobs then use their money to ensure that their kids are able to get these high paying jobs starting with placing them in expensive pre-schools and high schools to give them the best chance to get into the highly regarded universities to give them the best chance at getting the high paying jobs. As a result, what the author calls the superordinate working class works harder and longer than they ever have before, essentially exploiting their own skills just to maintain their place. Another result is that innovations are more skewed towards the skills that the superordinate workers already have, making their skills even more valuable. In the end nobody wins.
    + "The division between gloomy and glossy jobs causes elites to give their children the extraordinary investments needed to get the glossy jobs."
    + "The rise of an elaborately educated elite induces the innovations that bias work and income to favor the skills that this elite possesses."
    + "What is conventionally called merit is actually an ideological conceit, constructed the launder a fundamentally unjust allocation of advantage."
    + "Meritocratic inequality divides society into the useless and the used up."


* [Biased](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557462/biased-by-jennifer-l-eberhardt-phd/9780735224933/) - This book was great at balancing academic studies on racial biases with personal anecdotes. I found it startling how much of an influence priming can have on racial biases (black faces are more likely to be picked out when induced to think about crime, aggressive words are more likely to be picked out after being shown photos of black faces) and the role that this can play in police being more violent towards black men.
    + There is less brain activity in the areas that process faces when someone sees a face of someone of a different race than their own.
    + "Categorization - grouping like things together - is not some abhorrent feature of the human brain, a process that some people engage in and other do not. Rather, it is a universal function of the brain that allows us to organize and manage the overload of the stimuli that constantly bombard us."
    + "Bias, even when we are not conscious of it, has consequences that we need to understand and mitigate. The stereotypic associations we carry in out heads can affect what we perceive, how we think, and the actions we take."
    + "In a series of studies, they asked people to rate the height, weight, and strength of young black and white men from photographs showing only their faces. Study participants consistently rated black men as taller, heavier and stronger than white men."
    + In a study involving a mock altercation between a black man and a white man that students didn't know was scripted "the students used a much lower threshold for labeling black actions as violent."
    + "The same fear response that's supposed to keep us safe can activate bias in ways that stigmatize and threaten others."
    + "Research supports the notion that raising the issue of race and discrimination explicitly can lead people to be more open-minded and act more fairly, particularly when they have time to reflect on their choices."
    + "Encouraging children to remain blind to race dampened their detection of discrimination, which had ripple effects. Color blindness promoted exactly the opposite of what was intended: racial inequality."
    + "It's true that we are wired for bias. But the problem with narrowly settling for that perspective is that it can lead us to care less about the danger associated with bias, instead of more. When something is regarded as a norm, people cease to judge it as harshly. ... They feel less agency and less motivation to change."
    + "The worry is that groups that sign on the the easy, socially responsible training might be less likely to attempt to mitigate bias and address inequities later, especially when it's hard - when it involves changes in cultural practices and policies, for example."
    + "When we are forced to make quick decisions using subjective criteria, the potential for bias is great."

* [Countdown to Zero Day](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/219931/countdown-to-zero-day-by-kim-zetter/) - A detailed account of Stuxnet, a malicious computer worm, sabotaged an Iranian nuclear facility by targeting the programmable logic controllers in the facility to ruin their centrifuges. The book goes into detail on how it was discovered by a small group of security researchers and the level of sophistication that went into the attack and related intelligence gathering attacks as well as the sloppiness that lead to its detection after going undetected for years. It also touches on what it means for the future of cyber attacks.
    + "The targets most in danger from a digital attack in the United States are not just military systems but civilian ones - transportation, communication, and financial networks; food manufacturing and chemical plants; gas pipelines, water, and electric utilities; even uranium enrichment plants."
    + "A bomb dropped on a target might cause collateral damage, but it would be local. Computer networks, however, are complex mazes of interconnectivity, and a cyberweapon's path and impact once unleashed aren't always predictable."

* [A Field Guide to Lies](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/318650/a-field-guide-to-lies-by-daniel-j-levitin/) - A lot of the stuff in here as stuff I was already aware of but it's always good be reminded to step back and think things through before accepting a claim as true, especially if it confirms your prior belief.
    + "But it's important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations."
    + "We also have a tendency to apply critical thinking only to things we disagree with. In the current information age, pseudofacts masquerade as facts, misinformation can be indistinguishable from true information, and numbers are often at the heart of any important claim or decision."

* [The Fifth Risk](https://wwnorton.com/books/the-fifth-risk) - An alarming look at the potential risks of having so many incompetent people in major government positions under the Trump administration, whether it be at the Department of Energy or the Department of Agriculture. People with detailed knowledge on how programs at these places work got replaced by people who couldn't even meet the most basic requirements for entry level positions. The general consensus on the most worrying thing for the former employees is the potential disasters that could stem from the commitment to scientific ignorance from people in positions of power. Things like scaling back environmental and food safety regulations, giving research money to those who will produce the political results you want and restricting access to data from government funded sources.
    + "At any rate, the serious risk in Iran wasn't that the Iranians would secretly acquire a weapon. It was that the president of the United States would not understand his nuclear scientists' reasoning about the unlikelihood of the Iranians obtaining a weapon, and that he would have the United States back away foolishly from the deal. Released from the complicated set of restrictions on its nuclear-power program, Iran would then build its bomb. It wasn't enough to have the world's finest forensic nuclear physicists. Our political leaders needed to be predisposed to listen to them and equipped to understand what they said."
    + A Department of Energy loan program for early-stage businesses that was criticized as wasteful spending due to one big failure. "No one had paid attention to it successes, and its one failure - Solyndra - had allowed right-wide friends of Big oil to bang on relentlessly about government waste and fraud and stupidity." After some digging it was discovered that they weren't taking enough risk and "the fear of losses that might in turn be twisted into antigovernment propaganda was threatening its mission." This program was canceled under Trump.
    + "Early-stage innovation in most industries would not have been possible without government support in a variety of ways, and it's especially true in energy. So the notion that we are just going to privatize early-stage innovation is ridiculous Other countries are outspending us in R&D, and we are going to pay a price."
    + "Here is where the Trump administration's willful ignorance plays a role. If your ambition is to maximize the short-term gain without regard to the long-term cost, you are better off not knowing the cost. If you want to preserve your personal immunity to the hard problems, it's better to never really understand the problems. There is an upside to ignorance, and a downside to knowledge."
    + "Junk science will be used to muddy issues like childhood nutrition. Maybe sodium isn't as bad for kids as people say! There's no such thing as too much sugar! The science will suddenly be 'unclear'. There will no longer be truth and falsehood. There will just be stories with tow sides to them."
    + "In the red southern states the mayor sometimes would say, 'Can you not mention that the government gave this?' Even when it was saving lives, or preserving communities, the government remained oddly invisible... We don't teach people what the government actually does."
    + "Without weather satellites, weather radar, weather buoys, and weather balloons, there would be no weather forecasting worth listening to, much less paying for. Whatever AccuWeather - and any other private weather forecaster - might be doing to refine the National Weather Service's forecast also depended on having those forecasts in the first place."
    + "That was the sad truth - the public servants couldn't or wouldn't defend themselves, and few outside the US government had a deep interest in sticking up for them."
    + "Pause a moment to consider that audacity of that maneuver. A private company whose weather predictions were totally dependent on the billions of dollars spent by the US taxpayer to gather the data necessary for those predictions, and on decades of intellectual weather work sponsored by the US taxpayer, and on international data sharing treaties made on behalf of the US taxpayer, and on the very forecasts that the National Weather Service generated, was, in effect, trying to force the US taxpayer to pay all over again for what the National Weather Service might be able to tell him or her for free." That is what AccuWeather wants, and their CEO, Barry Myers, was Trump's nomination to run the NOAA. [Fortunately he has withdrawn.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/barry-myers-noaa-nomination.html) Essentially trying to take a public good, paid for with taxpayer dollars and restrict it to the few who profit off that data by privatizing weather forecasts.
    + "Virtually all the satellite data that came into NOAA wound up in places where no one could ever see it again. The Weather Company simply sought to render it accessible to the public. Myers threatened to sue the Weather Service if they did it."
    + "The private weather industry, unlike the National Weather Service, has a financial interest in catastrophe. The more spectacular and expensive the disasters, the more the people will pay for the warning of them... The more they pay, the more the weather industry can afford to donate to elected officials, and the more influence it will gain on the political process... You know Hurricane Harvey is going to do to Houston before Houston knows: Do you help Houston? Or do you find clever ways to make money off Houston's destructions."
    + "While the tornado was touching down in Moore, AccuWeather's network channel was broadcasting videos of ... hippos, swimming." This is after they sent out an alert to their paying customers 12 minutes before the tornado touched down.
