Some notes and quotes from the books I have read this year:

* [The Meritocracy Trap](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/548174/the-meritocracy-trap-by-daniel-markovits/) - The meritocracy trap is basically a snowball effect in which middle class jobs get displaced by more highly skilled, higher paying jobs. Those with the higher paying jobs then use their money to ensure that their kids are able to get these high paying jobs starting with placing them in expensive pre-schools and high schools to give them the best chance to get into the highly regarded universities to give them the best chance at getting the high paying jobs. As a result, what the author calls the superordinate working class works harder and longer than they ever have before, essentially exploiting their own skills just to maintain their place. Another result is that innovations are more skewed towards the skills that the superordinate workers already have, making their skills even more valuable. In the end nobody wins.
    + "The division between gloomy and glossy jobs causes elites to give their children the extraordinary investments needed to get the glossy jobs."
    + "The rise of an elaborately educated elite induces the innovations that bias work and income to favor the skills that this elite possesses."
    + "What is conventionally called merit is actually an ideological conceit, constructed the launder a fundamentally unjust allocation of advantage."
    + "Meritocratic inequality divides society into the useless and the used up."


* [Biased](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557462/biased-by-jennifer-l-eberhardt-phd/9780735224933/) - This book was great at balancing academic studies on racial biases with personal anecdotes. I found it startling how much of an influence priming can have on racial biases (black faces are more likely to be picked out when induced to think about crime, aggressive words are more likely to be picked out after being shown photos of black faces) and the role that this can play in police being more violent towards black men.
    + There is less brain activity in the areas that process faces when someone sees a face of someone of a different race than their own.
    + "Categorization - grouping like things together - is not some abhorrent feature of the human brain, a process that some people engage in and other do not. Rather, it is a universal function of the brain that allows us to organize and manage the overload of the stimuli that constantly bombard us."
    + "Bias, even when we are not conscious of it, has consequences that we need to understand and mitigate. The stereotypic associations we carry in out heads can affect what we perceive, how we think, and the actions we take."
    + "In a series of studies, they asked people to rate the height, weight, and strength of young black and white men from photographs showing only their faces. Study participants consistently rated black men as taller, heavier and stronger than white men."
    + In a study involving a mock altercation between a black man and a white man that students didn't know was scripted "the students used a much lower threshold for labeling black actions as violent."
    + "The same fear response that's supposed to keep us safe can activate bias in ways that stigmatize and threaten others."
    + "Research supports the notion that raising the issue of race and discrimination explicitly can lead people to be more open-minded and act more fairly, particularly when they have time to reflect on their choices."
    + "Encouraging children to remain blind to race dampened their detection of discrimination, which had ripple effects. Color blindness promoted exactly the opposite of what was intended: racial inequality."
    + "It's true that we are wired for bias. But the problem with narrowly settling for that perspective is that it can lead us to care less about the danger associated with bias, instead of more. When something is regarded as a norm, people cease to judge it as harshly. ... They feel less agency and less motivation to change."
    + "The worry is that groups that sign on the the easy, socially responsible training might be less likely to attempt to mitigate bias and address inequities later, especially when it's hard - when it involves changes in cultural practices and policies, for example."
    + "When we are forced to make quick decisions using subjective criteria, the potential for bias is great."
