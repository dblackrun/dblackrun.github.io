Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Rise in cashless payments stokes concerns over data security](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/article-rise-in-cashless-payments-stokes-concerns-over-data-security/)

* [Old, Online, And Fed On Lies: How An Aging Population Will Reshape The Internet](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/old-and-online-fake-news-aging-population) - "Four recent studies found that older Americans are more likely to consume and share false online news than those in other age groups, even when controlling for factors such as partisanship. Other research has found that older Americans have a poor or inaccurate grasp of how algorithms play a role in selecting what information is shown to them on social media, are worse than younger people at differentiating between reported news and opinion, and are less likely to register the brand of a news site they consume information from."

* [YouTube Executives Ignored Warnings, Letting Toxic Videos Run Rampant](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-04-02/youtube-executives-ignored-warnings-letting-toxic-videos-run-rampant)

* [Exponent Podcast: YouTube and the End of Friction](https://stratechery.com/2019/exponent-podcast-youtube-and-the-end-of-friction/)
