Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Thank you for posting: Smoking’s lessons for regulating social media](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/05/1009231/social-media-facebook-tobacco-secondhand-smoke/)

* [The Benefits of Statistical Noise](https://behavioralscientist.org/the-benefits-of-statistical-noise/) - "when situations lack a single right answer, trying to reduce unwanted variability by eliminating noise can inadvertently eliminate useful information as well."
