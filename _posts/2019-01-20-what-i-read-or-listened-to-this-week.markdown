Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Facebook's '10 Year Challenge' Is Just a Harmless Memeâ€”Right?](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-10-year-meme-challenge/) - While I'm not sure the data would actually be used, due to the reasons mentioned in the article, it is a good thing that these questions are being asked.

* [The FBI Says Its Photo Analysis Is Scientific Evidence. Scientists Disagree.](https://www.propublica.org/article/with-photo-analysis-fbi-lab-continues-shaky-forensic-science-practices) - I wonder how many people are in prison based on unreliable forensic methods.

* [Why Behavioral Scientists Need to Think Harder About the Future](http://behavioralscientist.org/why-behavioral-scientists-need-to-think-harder-about-the-future/)
