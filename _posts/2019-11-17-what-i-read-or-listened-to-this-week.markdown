Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Inside the Toxic Culture of the Nike Oregon Project 'Cult'](https://www.si.com/track-and-field/2019/11/13/mary-cain-nike-oregon-project-toxic-culture-alberto-salazar-abuse-investigation) - I'm glad so much has come to light about Salazar. There have been anonymous message board rumours about him for years.

* [Harnessing the Power of Shower Thoughts](https://alexanderell.is/posts/trust-in-your-unconscious/) - I've solved many problems when I was out for a run.

* ['Recorder': Meet The Woman Who Recorded 70,000 Tapes Of American News](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/11/14/recorder-the-marion-stokes-project)
