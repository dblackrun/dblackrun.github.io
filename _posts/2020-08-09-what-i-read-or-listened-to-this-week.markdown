Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Chuck Norris and Hacking Twitter](https://themargins.substack.com/p/chuck-norris-and-hacking-twitter)

* [Can Killing Cookies Save Journalism?](https://www.wired.com/story/can-killing-cookies-save-journalism/) - "The experience of NPO is perhaps the strongest counter-example to some of the biggest claims made in defense of targeted advertising based on tracking users online. Microtargeting is supposed to help advertisers reach the right people, but advertisers converted more new customers using the contextual approach. It’s supposed to help publishers make money, but NPO is making a lot more money since it abandoned cookies. It’s supposed to give users ads that they would prefer to see, but NPO’s users overwhelmingly declined to trade relevance for surveillance. Of course, we’re still talking about one case, but it raises the question whether anyone besides ad tech companies benefits from the status quo."
