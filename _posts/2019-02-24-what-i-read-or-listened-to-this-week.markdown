Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [YouTube Continues To Promote Anti-Vax Videos As Facebook Prepares To Fight Medical Misinformation](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/youtube-anti-vaccination-video-recommendations) - "Thereâ€™s always been asymmetry of passion on social platforms: The most compelling content is the most sensational"

* [How Big a Problem Is It That a Few Shareholders Own Stock in So Many Competing Companies?](https://hbr.org/2019/02/how-big-a-problem-is-it-that-a-few-shareholders-own-stock-in-so-many-competing-companies)

* [Ad code 'slows down' browsing speeds](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47252725) - "About 60% of the total loading time of a page was caused by scripts that place adverts or analyse what users do"

* [Data science is different now](https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/) - "What is becoming clear is that, in the late stage of the hype cycle, data science is asymptotically moving closer to engineering, and the skills that data scientists need moving forward are less visualization and statistics-based, and more in line with traditional computer science curricula"
