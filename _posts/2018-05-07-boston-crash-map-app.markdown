The city of Boston publishes a lot of data on their [open data hub](https://data.boston.gov/). One of the the recently released datasets is their [crash records](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/vision-zero-crash-records). It contains the date, time and location for all incidents where a public safety response was dispatched. I made an app that puts the locations on a map where you can filter by crash type, year, month, day of the week and time of day. The app url is [boston-crash-map.herokuapp.com](https://boston-crash-map.herokuapp.com/) and the source code is on github [here](https://github.com/dblackrun/boston_crash_records).
