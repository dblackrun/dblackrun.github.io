Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [No, A.I. Won’t Solve the Fake News Problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/opinion/sunday/ai-fake-news-disinformation-campaigns.html)

* [Older People Are Worse Than Young People at Telling Fact from Opinion](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/older-people-are-worse-than-young-people-at-telling-fact-from-opinion/573739/) - It's scary how few people could correctly identify all the statements as facts or opinions.

* [Apps Installed On Millions Of Android Phones Tracked User Behavior To Execute A Multimillion-Dollar Ad Fraud Scheme](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/how-a-massive-ad-fraud-scheme-exploited-android-phones-to) - Ad fraud is very underreported topic.

* [A skeptic’s guide to thinking about AI](https://www.fastcompany.com/90252753/a-skeptics-guide-to-thinking-about-ai) - "Despite rhetoric that claims AI will solve a host of human ills, we have to be careful it doesn’t enable or exacerbate them first."
