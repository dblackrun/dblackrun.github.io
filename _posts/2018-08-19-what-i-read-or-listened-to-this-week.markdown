Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [2018 RITSAC Morning 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5AkF0Cce8c) - I haven't watched all the talks from the RIT Sports Analytics Conference yet, but I enjoyed both the talks by Matt Cane and Seth Partnow in this video.

* [How Accessible is Psychology Data?](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2018/08/06/how-accessible-is-psychology-data/) - Two researchers contacted the authors of 111 of the most cited papers in psychology and psychiatry to try to get access to the underlying data. Only 14% made their data available with no restrictions. "The importance of data sharing – to ensure reproducibility and to stimulate further analysis – is especially high when the data in question has already given rise to influential papers"

* [Talking About Failure Is Crucial for Growth. Here’s How to Do It Right.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/smarter-living/talking-about-failure-is-crucial-for-growth-heres-how-to-do-it-right.html)

* [There Is More to Behavioral Economics Than Biases and Fallacies](http://behavioralscientist.org/there-is-more-to-behavioral-science-than-biases-and-fallacies/) - "Emphasizing the counterintuitive nature of certain behaviors is a surefire way to gain popular press, these infographics can go viral and do more harm than good. Surprise can make people renounce their prior beliefs and uncritically adopt the opposite view. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and much of the popular treatment of behavioral economics is, really, barely more than a little knowledge"

* [Don’t ostracize drugs users – empathize with them](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-dont-ostracize-drugs-users-empathize-with-them/) - "Addiction is neither a choice nor primarily a disease, genetic or acquired. It originates in a person’s attempt to solve genuine human problems: those of emotional loss, of overwhelming stress, of lost connection"
