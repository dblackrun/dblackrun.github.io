Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [This Is How We Radicalized The World](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-facebook-elections)

* [Why big companies squander brilliant ideas](http://timharford.com/2018/10/why-big-companies-squander-brilliant-ideas/) - "Disruption describes what happens when firms fail because they keep making the kinds of choices that made them successful." "Dominant organisations are prone to stumble when the new technology requires a new organisational structure. An innovation might be radical but, if it fits the structure that already existed, an incumbent firm has a good chance of carrying its lead from the old world to the new."

* [Higher Wages Aren’t Enough to Turn Mediocre Jobs into Good Ones](https://hbr.org/2018/10/higher-wages-arent-enough-to-turn-mediocre-jobs-into-good-ones) - "Even highly skilled and motivated workers will not be able to be as productive as expected because the company’s operational systems got in their way, wasting rather than maximizing their skills and enthusiasm." "Higher wages may not even allow companies to meet workers’ basic needs if companies are not offering livable take-home pay, predictable schedules, and clear career paths."

* [To Combat Harassment, More Companies Should Try Bystander Training](https://hbr.org/2018/10/to-combat-harassment-more-companies-should-try-bystander-training) - "That research shows that training bystanders how to recognize, intervene, and show empathy to targets of assault not only increases awareness and improves attitudes, but also encourages bystanders to disrupt assaults before they happen, and help survivors report and seek support after the fact."
