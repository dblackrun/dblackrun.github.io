Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Understanding the Threat of “Surveillance Capitalism”](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/themarkup/issues/understanding-the-threat-of-surveillance-capitalism-350921)

* [super social safety nets](https://www.regs2riches.com/p/-super-social-safety-nets) - "It’s a question of what people have trouble paying out of pocket for, and what the role of the state is. They should be part of a reality check when decision-makers set their agendas and draft their policies, and treated with just as much import as public opinion polling on what people THINK they want.
