Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [How Performance Evaluations Hurt Gender Equality](http://behavioralscientist.org/how-performance-evaluations-hurt-gender-equality/) - I like that this included suggestions to minimize bias based on the existing research.

* [When the Robot Doesnâ€™t See Dark Skin](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/opinion/facial-analysis-technology-bias.html) - Using facial recognition to make real life decisions is a bad idea.

* [Organizing Data Science Teams (with Jonathan Nolis)](https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/organizing-data-science-teams) - This was probably my favourite episode of the Data Framed podcast to date.

* [Kyle Knapp - Automating Code Quality - PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1lDk_WKXvY)
