Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [I Don’t Want to Shoot You, Brother](https://features.propublica.org/weirton/police-shooting-lethal-force-cop-fired-west-virginia/)

* [Did a Rave Review Really Shut Down Portland Burger Bar Stanich’s? Maybe It Was the Owner’s Legal Troubles](https://www.wweek.com/news/2018/11/28/did-a-rave-review-really-shut-down-portland-burger-bar-stanichs-maybe-it-was-the-owners-legal-troubles/) - Turns out that "I Found the Best Burger Place in America. And Then I Killed It." story from a few weeks ago was missing some important details.

* [How Instagram hides behind Facebook – and rakes in billions](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/01/instagram-facebook-controversy-social-network-tech) - With all the negative press around Facebook people seem to forget they own Instagram.

* [Exploiting developer infrastructure is insanely easy](https://medium.com/@jsoverson/exploiting-developer-infrastructure-is-insanely-easy-9849937e81d4) - "The problem is that so much software is built on the backs of people who are expected to work for free. They deliver useful software once but are expected to maintain it until the end of time. If they can’t, either they go dormant and ignore requests or security vulnerabilities (guilty!) or they pass the baton over to someone else hoping that they can get away without getting tagged ever again"
