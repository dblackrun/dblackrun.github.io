Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Beware of Automated Hiring](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/opinion/ai-hiring-discrimination.html) - "Automated hiring can create a closed loop system. Advertisements created by algorithms encourage certain people to send in their résumés. After the résumés have undergone automated culling, a lucky few are hired and then subjected to automated evaluation, the results of which are looped back to establish criteria for future job advertisements and selections. This system operates with no transparency or accountability built in to check that the criteria are fair to all job applicants."

* [How a study based on a typo made news everywhere — and the retraction didn’t](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/3/20895240/study-typo-religion-children-generosity-retraction)

* [Limiting message forwarding on WhatsApp helped slow disinformation](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614435/whatsapp-disinformation-message-forwarding-politics-technology-brazil-india-election/)
