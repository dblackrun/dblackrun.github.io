Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Episode 110: The Shiny-Object Psychology of American Capitalist “Innovation”](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-110-the-shiny-object-psychology-of-american-capitalist-innovation)

* [Behind the Big Tech antitrust backlash: A turning point for America](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-facebook-google-antitrust-backlash-152518336.html)

* [Aiming for novelty in coronavirus coverage, journalists end up sensationalizing the trivial and untrue](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/05/aiming-for-novelty-in-coronavirus-coverage-journalists-end-up-sensationalizing-the-trivial-and-untrue/) - "Yet the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed how journalism’s traditional bias for novelty can result in front-page, top-of-the-broadcast news stories that are provably inaccurate, and even occasionally fictional. The tendency of journalists to inflate the value of certain new information makes the media manipulable and easy to exploit."
