Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Facebook pays teens to install VPN that spies on them](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/) - "If Facebook makes full use of the level of access they are given by asking users to install the Certificate, they will have the ability to continuously collect the following types of data: private messages in social media apps, chats from in instant messaging apps – including photos/videos sent to others, emails, web searches, web browsing activity, and even ongoing location information by tapping into the feeds of any location tracking apps you may have installed."

* [Facebook Moves to Block Ad Transparency Tools — Including Ours](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-blocks-ad-transparency-tools)
