Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Everything is Amazing, But Nothing is Ours](https://alexdanco.com/2019/10/26/everything-is-amazing-but-nothing-is-ours/)

* [Gaggle Knows Everything About Teens And Kids In School](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/gaggle-school-surveillance-technology-education) - Why are we are normalizing mass surveillance? ""“One of the things [Gaggle is] teaching is not to share things, which is presumably the opposite of what many mental health professionals would say,” Igo said. If a student is afraid of being interviewed by school administrators, they may shut themselves off from adults."

* [I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb)

* [How to make sure your question gets answered online](https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/09/11/answer-questions-online/) - "Asking good questions is a time investment. But, you’re expecting the person answering your question to put in time for you, too. So, it’s an investment that will pay dividends."
