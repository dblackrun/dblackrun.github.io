Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Firefox Is Back. It’s Time to Give It a Try.](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/technology/personaltech/firefox-chrome-browser-privacy.html) - I switched to Firefox recently because of its privacy features.

* [Bias detectives: the researchers striving to make algorithms fair](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05469-3)

* [Bad Science](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Science-Quacks-Pharma-Flacks/dp/0771035780/) - This book should be required reading in the current state of misleading/clickbait headlines for stories designed to bring out an emotional response.

* [Amber Brown ("HawkOwl") - How We Do Identity Wrong - PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5tPhUKljuY) - A lot more thought goes into collecting personal information than you would think.

* [Talking With The Tinmen – A Live Chat With Drew Hunter, Sam Parsons, Reed Fischer, Tyler Mueller and Tom Schwartz](http://citiusmag.com/citius-mag-podcast-tinman-elite/) - Good discussion with Tinman and some of the athletes he coaches. Tom Schwartz aka Tinman is one of the best distance running minds out there.

* [Esther Nam - One weird trick to becoming a better software developer - PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYWlfVqBQLc) - This could be renamed to "One weird trick to becoming better at anything"
