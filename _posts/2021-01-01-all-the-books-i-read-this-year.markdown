Some notes and quotes from the books I have read this year:

* [Putin's People](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374712785) - The story of how Putin and a group of KGB men rose to power by going after the oligarchs who came to power after the fall of the Soviet Union and replacing them with their own people. Then they started funneling that money into the western countries to attempt to destabilize the West.

* [Rapture](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/rapture-fifteen-teams-four-countries/9780316540179-item.html) - Nick Nurse's journey to becoming an NBA championship winning coach.

* [The Lac-MÃ©gantic Rail Disaster](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9781459413412/bruce-campbell/the-lac-megantic-rail-disaster)
    + Regulator capture led to safety regulations being removed and industry policing itself. When this happens profit takes precedence over safety.
    + Experts had been warning since the 1990s that the railcars used to transport oil were unsafe.
    + Less regulation over transport by rail compared to pipelines led to more volatile crude oil being transported by rail.
    + They shifted to one person crews and didn't change the safety recommendations and training programs to save costs.
    + "employees were not allowed to refuse overweight trains"
    + The day before, a locomotive engineer reported issues with the locomotive.
    + Proper braking was not applied, in part to avoid the delay from disengaging the system the next morning.
    + Unsafe DOT-111 cars were phased out after the accident, despite opposition from the Harper government. Transportation Safety Board chair pushed for it knowing it would likely mean she would not be re-appointed as chair.
    + Initial report on the accident had many contributing factors relating to the decision to allow one person trains. These were all removed in the final report due to a lack of true independence. "The Prime Minister's Office's hands were all over it."
    + On the Safe and Accountable Rail Act introduced following the accident: "The Act's main purpose, however, was to ensure that industry had enough insurance to cover future accidents, so government would be spared the tab."
    + Criminal trial for the three low-level workers resulted in them being acquitted of criminal negligence.
    + "All criminal and civil actions have been settled behind closed doors without going to trial except the criminal charges against Harding and his fellow workers. The only people who testified were low-level company and government employees, and police investigators. No company executives; no senior government officials, especially those who made and approved the decision to allow Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway to operate its trains with single-person crews; no politicians responsible for transportation policy and overall regulatory and budgetary policy; no industry leaders - none of them were compelled to testify. As a vehicle to uncover the truth, the legal system failed miserably."
    + No real changes to regulations since the accident so it is just a matter of time before it happens again.

* [The Ku Klux Klan in Canada](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9781459506138/allan-bartley/ku-klux-klan-in-canada)
    + Began after the release of the movie The Birth of a Nation
    + Different people came from the US and tried to get it started in Canada but in the early years it wasn't very organized, in part because the organizers were mostly trying to profit off hate and racial violence.
    + Black people weren't the only targets, basically all non-Protestants.
    + Moose Jaw was a central point for activity because it was where multiple rail lines intersected.
    + Not a lot of police investigation into the Klan compared to other hate groups. Much like today, people were worried too many police agreed with the racism of the Klan to report their activity to the police.
    + Klan played a role in the Saskatchewan provincial election in 1929, helping elect the Conservative candidate.
    + Things died down in the lead up to the second World War.
    + Rise of right-wing groups along with David Duke promoting the Klan in Canada revived the it in the 1970s.
    + Canadian Klan leadership members were involved in attempting to overthrow the government of Dominica.
    + The arrests that followed effectively ended an sort of national organization in Canada and from them it was more regional, especially in Quebec, and disorganized.
    + Internet gave rise to new recruitment methods and the Harper government removing the ability of individuals to seek redress against cyber hate helped give rise to more hate speech online.
    + A major area of recruitment was within the military.

* [The Hype Machine](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/570128/the-hype-machine-by-sinan-aral/)
    + It is actually true that false information spreads faster than true information. "It took the truth approximately six times as long as falsehood to reach 1500 people and twenty times as long to travel ten reshares from the origin tweet in a retweet cascade. Falsehood spread significantly more broadly and was retweeted by more unique users than the truth at every cascade depth."
    + The four factors that guide how social media affects us are money, code, norms and laws.
    + "But the Hype Machine delivers social information in incredibly rich detail and at an unprecedented scale. As it does so, it stimulates our brains in ways that we have evolved to crave, which keeps us coming back for more. When we consider who we are and how we are mentally wired, the meteoric rise of social media is, in some sense, unsurprising - like the inevitable consequence of tossing a lit match into a pool of gasoline."
    + "when we see social media images with more likes, we zoom in and inspect them in greater detail. We pay more attention to online information when it is valued more highly by others."
    + "when we think about our own photos, we perceive them in their social context - we think about how other people are thinking about them."
    + "When we analyzed millions of people's running behavior over many years, we found people's social media connections and solidarity with their running peers over social media helped them stick with their running regimens and made their running habits resilient to disruption."
    + "neural activation caused by persuasive social media messages predicts individual- and population-level behaviors, especially information-sharing behaviors, better than we (or other outside experts) can predict our own behavior."
    + Measuring the effectiveness of online ads is hard and often done badly (people who click on ads rarely convert to sales and people who convert to sales rarely click on ads) and the effectiveness is often vastly overrated and spending continues because not very many people are incentivized to ask which ads aren't working.
    + Better to focus on reach than frequency like P&G did when they cut their digital marketing budget by 200 million and got a rise in organic sales growth.
    + Five strategies for communication in a hypersocialized world: network targeting, referral marketing, social advertising, viral design and influencer marketing
    + Reflection problem - is change of behavior due to friends convincing friends to change their behavior or homophily (friends sharing the same interests)
    + Showing social cues on ads (ex. Friends A, B and C like this brand) has a bigger impact on goods that confer status.
    + "what keeps our attention is the opposite of shock value, and that's authenticity. Local network effects are strongest for strong ties, not weak ties, because the long-term value provided by our close friends and family is greater then the short-term, attention-grabbing value of celebrity. This explains why microinfluencers generate more engagement than celebrity influencers."
    + Means are meaningless. With mircortargeting we don't care about the mean impact. Something could have no average effect but a large effect on a small group, and that is what counts. "Though the average effect of digital ads on vote choices may be small or nonexistent, if the right sub-groups are targeted and influenced in the right geographies - in the right states or voting districts - the potential to move elections remains real."
    + The three pillars of the wisdom of the crowds - independence, diversity and equality are all undermined by the Hype Machine.
    + In a study that randomly assigned people human curated or algorithmic curated news algorithmic curation outperformed human curation in maximizing user engagement, caused a filter bubble and caused reading choices to narrow.
    + "The most recent experiments on the wisdom of the crowds show that this type of adaptive network can achieve crowd wisdom that outperforms independent groups and the best-performing individuals when it is provided with high-quality performance feedback. This means, under the right conditions, our increasing interdependence and hypersocialization can be assets for human civilization rather than liabilities."
    + "Structural reform of social media - though a commitment to making data and social graphs portable, allowing consumers to take their data to competing companies the way we do in the telecommunications industry, and forward-looking merger oversight - offers a more comprehensive, long-term solution."
    + "As we regulate privacy, we must not limit our ability to audit, study, and understand the Hype Machine."
    + Research "safe harbors" for scientists to analyze sensitive data should be established. Similar things exist with sensitive medical data and census data that have limits on the types and amount of data that can be used and background checks are done on the people using the data. Social media companies should also be required to make data available for research into the most pressing issues of public interest.

* [Because Internet](https://gretchenmcculloch.com/book/)
    + Weak ties introduce new forms of language, strong ties spread them. The internet makes language change faster because it makes it is easier to find weak ties.
    + Much like history is written by the winners, the "correct" grammar is set and passed down by the elite. Think how this impacts algorithmic spelling and grammar checks.
    + "In English, the association of words from African American English with coolness and their subsequent appropriation by non-African Americans is much older than the internet" ... "Fittingly the internet has come up with a word for this: columbusing, or white people claiming to discover something that was already well established in another community"
    + Old Internet People - the first wave of people to go online. They mostly interacted with strangers because they were online before their friends were.
    + Full Internet People - came of age in the early days of the social internet (late 1990s and early 2000s). More interaction with their friends through AIM, MSN, ICQ. Picked up internet slang from their friends.
    + Semi Internet People - came online the same time as Full Internet People but less for social purposes and more for work or keeping up with the news
    + Pre Internet People - were around for the previous waves, just never really used the internet and have gradually found their way online.
    + Post Internet People - people who haven't known a world without the social internet
    + Typing in all caps, expressive lengtheninggg, ~irony punctuation~, minimal punctuation and capitalization are all forms of expressing tone through typography and they have evolved over time (all caps wasn't meant to convey yelling in the early days of computing)
    + Macro-level conversation norms change over time. What may have been a standard greeting 100 years ago would be weird now.
    + "The changeability of language is its strength: if children had to copy exactly how their parents spoke in order for language to be transmitted, language would be brittle and fragile. It would be losable, the way ancient techniques for art or architecture can be lost. But because we remake language at every generation, because we learn it from our peers, not just our elders, because we can make ourselves understood even though we all speak subtly different personal varieties, language is flexible and strong."

* [Policing Black Lives](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/policing-black-lives/9781552669792)
    + Slavery in Canada is a subject that isn't taught in schools and is under-researched. There is a lack of Black Studies departments in Canadian universities.
    + Structurally mandated Black impoverishment led to white hostility. Black people taking low wage jobs led to a race riot in Shelburne, Nova Scotia in 1784.
    + There were still segregated schools in Canada in the 1980s. In the 1800s schools for Black kids were intended to teach obedience and submission so they might better accept their role as menial labourers.
    + Immigration policy in the early 1900s was meant to make it easier for white people to be allowed entry to Canada. You could be denied entry based on being deemed unsuited to the climate of Canada. Medical examiners were paid a government bonus for turning away Black migrants. The Department of Immigration paid black American doctors to convince potential migrants that the Canadian climate was dangerous.
    + "The politicization of rape was far less about protecting white women than it was about justifying the oppression of Black men." White women raped by white men often received little legal protection or public support.
    + "Prostitution laws were weaponized to arrest and imprison Black and Indigenous women, along with poor and working-class Irish women, who were, at the time, considered less ideal settlers than other white Europeans."
    + "The devaluation of Black life has widely justified a worldwide and national devaluation of Black labour, which serves the interest of capital."
    + "Multiculturalism has served a role similar to that of the Underground Railroad, allowing Canadian state officials and the general public to congratulate themselves on Canada's comparative benevolence, while rendering invisible the acute economic and material deprivation currently facing many Black communities."
    + "public associations between Blackness and crime can be traced back to runaway slave advertisements dating back to the seventeenth century, in which self-liberated Blacks were portrayed as thieves and criminals. All free and enslaved people were subject to the surveillance of a larger white community and law enforcement officials"
    + In 2014 it was reported that a police college in Montreal was teaching that Blacks were more likely to commit crimes of violence, theft and sexual assault.
    + Under Harper: "This era saw a significant investment in building and filling prisons, seemingly at any cost. Prison expansion was given fiscal priority at a time when the government enacted significant austerity measures: social investments were cut across nearly every sector besides prison and the military"
    + Drug prohibition, not drugs, is a larger public safety and health issue (2016 study by the Lancet and John Hopkins)
    + "The result of the drug war has not been the protection of society, but the extensive caging of Black communities."
    + Black women are frequently left out in the discussion on issues around racial and gender oppression. Those are often centered around Black mean and white women.
    + Inaccurate reports about Somali refugees collecting upwards of $100k a year in fraudulent welfare claims played a major role in social panic around welfare fraud. This resulted in changes made to make it more difficult to qualify for welfare checks and an increase in surveillance of single Black mothers.
    + "Many people living in poverty and precarious housing are unable to store years of paperwork and identity documents. Yet, many offenses under the umbrella of welfare fraud require decades of paperwork to prove innocence"
    + "Because women can be accused of welfare fraud for not having a reported 'spouse in the house,' many women fear having a romantic partner stay overnight, and others become trapped in situations of domestic abuse and coercion by partners who threaten to report them and allege fraud."
    + There is more investment in the surveillance and repression of welfare fraud offenses relative to the actual rate of offenses compared to things like white collar tax fraud.
    + "The harms created by an ideological rather than evidence-based approach to drug use in society continue to legitimate the vilification and dehumanization of Black women." Same thing with sex workers.
    + "Child welfare agencies have, since their inception, further entrenched white supremacy by destroying, on a large scale, the familial and communal networks of Black and Indigenous people. They have helped to establish a system of widespread surveillance, punishment and criminalization of Black families more broadly."
    + Black kids are not thought of as innocent youth the same way white kids are. This impacts how they are treated by teachers in school.
    + Referring to Black kids dropping out of school makes it seem like an individual problem. It should be referred to as pushed out because it is a systemic problem.
    + "Any legal reform, then, must be tied into concerted efforts toward seeing, naming and concertedly countering the demonization of Black life that permeates both state institutions and wider society." Otherwise there will just be new justifications for racial control.
