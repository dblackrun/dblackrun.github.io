Some notes and quotes from the books I have read this year:

* [Putin's People](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374712785) - The story of how Putin and a group of KGB men rose to power by going after the oligarchs who came to power after the fall of the Soviet Union and replacing them with their own people. Then they started funneling that money into the western countries to attempt to destabilize the West.

* [Rapture](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/rapture-fifteen-teams-four-countries/9780316540179-item.html) - Nick Nurse's journey to becoming an NBA championship winning coach.

* [The Lac-MÃ©gantic Rail Disaster](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9781459413412/bruce-campbell/the-lac-megantic-rail-disaster)
    + Regulator capture led to safety regulations being removed and industry policing itself. When this happens profit takes precedence over safety.
    + Experts had been warning since the 1990s that the railcars used to transport oil were unsafe.
    + Less regulation over transport by rail compared to pipelines led to more volatile crude oil being transported by rail.
    + They shifted to one person crews and didn't change the safety recommendations and training programs to save costs.
    + "employees were not allowed to refuse overweight trains"
    + The day before, a locomotive engineer reported issues with the locomotive.
    + Proper braking was not applied, in part to avoid the delay from disengaging the system the next morning.
    + Unsafe DOT-111 cars were phased out after the accident, despite opposition from the Harper government. Transportation Safety Board chair pushed for it knowing it would likely mean she would not be re-appointed as chair.
    + Initial report on the accident had many contributing factors relating to the decision to allow one person trains. These were all removed in the final report due to a lack of true independence. "The Prime Minister's Office's hands were all over it."
    + On the Safe and Accountable Rail Act introduced following the accident: "The Act's main purpose, however, was to ensure that industry had enough insurance to cover future accidents, so government would be spared the tab."
    + Criminal trial for the three low-level workers resulted in them being acquitted of criminal negligence.
    + "All criminal and civil actions have been settled behind closed doors without going to trial except the criminal charges against Harding and his fellow workers. The only people who testified were low-level company and government employees, and police investigators. No company executives; no senior government officials, especially those who made and approved the decision to allow Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway to operate its trains with single-person crews; no politicians responsible for transportation policy and overall regulatory and budgetary policy; no industry leaders - none of them were compelled to testify. As a vehicle to uncover the truth, the legal system failed miserably."
    + No real changes to regulations since the accident so it is just a matter of time before it happens again.

* [The Ku Klux Klan in Canada](https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/9781459506138/allan-bartley/ku-klux-klan-in-canada)
    + Began after the release of the movie The Birth of a Nation
    + Different people came from the US and tried to get it started in Canada but in the early years it wasn't very organized, in part because the organizers were mostly trying to profit off hate and racial violence.
    + Black people weren't the only targets, basically all non-Protestants.
    + Moose Jaw was a central point for activity because it was where multiple rail lines intersected.
    + Not a lot of police investigation into the Klan compared to other hate groups. Much like today, people were worried too many police agreed with the racism of the Klan to report their activity to the police.
    + Klan played a role in the Saskatchewan provincial election in 1929, helping elect the Conservative candidate.
    + Things died down in the lead up to the second World War.
    + Rise of right-wing groups along with David Duke promoting the Klan in Canada revived the it in the 1970s.
    + Canadian Klan leadership members were involved in attempting to overthrow the government of Dominica.
    + The arrests that followed effectively ended an sort of national organization in Canada and from them it was more regional, especially in Quebec, and disorganized.
    + Internet gave rise to new recruitment methods and the Harper government removing the ability of individuals to seek redress against cyber hate helped give rise to more hate speech online.
    + A major area of recruitment was within the military.
