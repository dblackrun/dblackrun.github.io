Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Biology of Desire](https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Desire-Why-Addiction-Disease/dp/1610397126/)

* [The Reading Brain (Why Your Brain Needs You to Read Every Day)](https://medium.com/@alltopstartups/the-reading-brain-why-your-brain-needs-you-to-read-every-day-f5307c50d979) - Part of the reason I started making these posts was for personal accountability to read more.

* [An Advocacy Group for Startups Is Funded by Google and Run by Ex-Googlers](https://theintercept.com/2018/05/30/google-engine-advocacy-tech-startups/) - It is always important to know where the money is coming from. "Google uses its prodigious war chest to fund think tanks, academic research, and “grassroots” groups, which then offer what can look to the uninitiated like independent viewpoints. The opinions and recommendations happen to line up with Google’s positions."

* [Michael Woods](https://www.innervoice.life/michael-woods) - Mike Woods' career arc from promising young 1500m runner to elite cyclist has been fun to follow.

* ["Bursty" Communication Can Help Remote Teams Thrive](http://behavioralscientist.org/bursty-communication-can-help-remote-teams-thrive/) - "People often think that constant communication is most effective, but actually, we find that bursts of rapid communication, followed by longer periods of silence, are telltale signs of successful teams."

* [The 'Thanksgiving Effect' and the Creepy Power of Phone Data](https://www.wired.com/story/the-thanksgiving-effect-and-the-power-of-phone-data/) - The effect being bigger for people who come from markets with lots of political television ads is very interesting.

* [Alex Gaynor - Learning From Failure: Post Mortems - PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Y2ap6vIMg) - Determining the root cause of a failure and figuring out how to learn from it is important.
