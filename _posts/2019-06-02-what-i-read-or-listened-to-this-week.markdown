Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [David Epstein on Mastery, Specialization, and Range](http://www.econtalk.org/david-epstein-on-mastery-specialization-and-range/)

* [Behavioral Ad Targeting Not Paying Off for Publishers, Study Suggests](https://www.wsj.com/articles/behavioral-ad-targeting-not-paying-off-for-publishers-study-suggests-11559167195) - Hopefully we can do more studies like this.

* [Cops Around The Country Are Posting Racist And Violent Comments On Facebook](https://www.injusticewatch.org/interactives/cops-troubling-facebook-posts-revealed/) - “This blows up the myth of bad apples, by the sheer number of images and numbers of individuals who are implicated,” said Nikki Jones, an associate professor of African American studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

* [When Can You Trust Your Intuition: The problem with having played the game](https://hockey-graphs.com/2019/05/30/when-can-you-trust-your-intuition-the-problem-with-having-played-the-game/) - "Whether they ever did play the game at a high level is not only irrelevant to their skill as talent evaluators, but it could even be a hindrance. Experience as a player is more likely to increase the likelihood of their own personal experiences introducing biases in their judgment and ability to differentiate between valid and invalid links with regards to observations and results."

* [The Platform Challenge: Balancing Safety, Privacy and Freedom — Alex Stamos (DataEDGE 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATmQj787Jcc)
