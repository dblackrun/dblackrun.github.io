Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Artificial Intelligence Hits the Barrier of Meaning](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/opinion/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.html) - "Imagine, for example, an airport security system that wonâ€™t let you board your flight because your face is confused with that of a criminal, or a self-driving car that, because of unusual lighting conditions, fails to notice that you are about to cross the street."

* [Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646#articleShareContainer) - "Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results"

* [Specification gaming examples in AI - master list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml) - A spreadsheet of cases of AI gaming the system including "AI trained to classify skin lesions as potentially cancerous learns that lesions photographed next to a ruler are more likely to be malignant."
