Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Distracted Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Distracted-Mind-Ancient-Brains-High-Tech/dp/0262534436/) - The main changes I will be making after reading this book are keeping my phone in another room when working and not using a phone/tablet/computer or watching TV within 30-60 minutes of going to sleep at night.

* [Trustworthy Data Analysis](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/06/04/trustworthy-data-analysis/)

* [Why the Best Things in Life Are All Backwards](https://markmanson.net/why-the-best-things-in-life-are-all-backwards) - "Effort and reward have a linear relationship when the action is mindless and simple. Effort and reward have a diminishing returns relationship when the action is complex and multivariate."

* [Analyzing Canada’s largest mutual funds: ‘Mediocre is kind in some cases’ (subs only)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-analysing-canadas-largest-mutual-funds-mediocre-is-kind-in-some/) - In the long term you are costing yourself a lot of money if you are putting your money in these high cost mutual funds instead of low cost ETFs and index funds.

* [101 Pandas Exercises for Data Analysis](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-pandas-exercises-python/) - A good resource for when you need to brush up on pandas.

* [Miguel Grinberg - Oops! I Committed My Password To GitHub! - PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I) - I have never done this but this is a good talk for what to do if it happens and helping prevent it from happening. It's good to know I have already been using the suggested practices.

* [Alex Petralia - Analyzing Data: What pandas and SQL Taught Me About Taking an Average - PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlgG0QdrqAU)
