Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Lessons hidden in sports betting markets](http://statsbylopez.netlify.com/post/lessons-hidden-in-sports-betting-markets/) - A good series of posts from recently hired NFL Director of Data and Analytics Michael Lopez.

* [Ego is the Enemy](https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818/) - Although I found some of the stories were cherry-picked or confirmation bias, there are still some good lessons here on how ego can hurt your success.

* [Perfection is useless](https://dev.to/markoa/perfection-is-useless-4c28) - Always good to remind yourself that getting stuff out there is often more valuable than taking longer and trying to make it perfect.

* [EU copyright reform: the facts](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2018/09/07/eu-copyright-reform-the-facts/) - This seems like a bad idea.

* [Cycling Is Key to Safer, Healthier, More Vital Cities](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/09/cycling-is-key-to-safer-healthier-more-vital-cities/570139/)

* [Maybe This Financial System Canâ€™t Be Fixed](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-09-14/maybe-this-financial-system-can-t-be-fixed) - "Experience has taught bankers not to worry about the downside. The government bailed them out with no personal repercussions and without fundamentally changing the system."

* [A Non-Technical Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://medium.com/@scyrus89/a-non-technical-introduction-to-cybersecurity-f4d42b9a1ff2)
