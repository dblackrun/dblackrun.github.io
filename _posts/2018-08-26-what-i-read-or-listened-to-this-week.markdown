Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Dying for a Paycheck: How Modern Management Harms Employee Health and Company Performanceâ€”and What We Can Do About It](https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Paycheck-Management-Employee-Performance/dp/0062800922/) - A good read reviewing studies on the negative health impacts of bad work environments ranging from long work hours, lack of job control, lack of health insurance and instability and stress from layoffs. It also has a good chapter on how people get "trapped" in a bad work environment and excuses they will use to avoid getting out.

* [Common Sense Eats Common Talk](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/09/26/common-sense-eats-common-talk/) - The author offers 3 rules of thumb for day-to-day decision making: 1 - When a proposition contradicts common sense, we should assume it to be wrong. 2 - If we cannot strip a statement of its jargon and rephrase in our own words, we are likely perpetuating common talk. 3 - Always test macro thoughts against micro examples.

* [Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233)

* [Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Done-Wrong-Woefully-Complete/dp/1593276206) - A must read for anyone who analyzes data. It will also make you skeptical of most results from peer reviewed papers. An overview and summary of the topics covered is [here](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/).

* [The Approval Economy](https://zandercutt.com/2018/08/23/the-approval-economy/)
