Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Music industry forces widely used journalist tool offline](https://freedom.press/news/riaa-github-youtube-dl-journalist-tool/)

* [How the experts messed up on Covid](https://unherd.com/2020/10/how-the-experts-messed-up-on-covid/) - "part of being an expert is knowing when to be uncertain, and being strongly aware of the provisional nature of our knowledge. Trustworthiness doesn’t just come from being right, but from communicating the limits of the evidence, and regularly updating one’s view in light of new data and analysis."

* [The Real Hunter Biden Story Everyone is Missing](https://zeynep.substack.com/p/ignoringblackmail)

* [In Defense of Elitism](https://www.grandcentralpublishing.com/titles/joel-stein/in-defense-of-elitism/9781455591473/)

* [The Black Box Society](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674970847)
