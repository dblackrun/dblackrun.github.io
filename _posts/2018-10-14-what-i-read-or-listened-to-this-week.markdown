Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Why Any Backdoor Would Be a Threat to Online Security](https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/why-a-backdoor-is-a-security-risk) - "We're not being asked to choose between security and privacy. We're being asked to choose between less security and more security."

* [Risky Business Feature: Named source in "The Big Hack" has doubts about the story](https://risky.biz/RB517_feature/) - I find it interesting how many security people have doubts about this story.

* [Coding Blocks Podcast](https://www.codingblocks.net/category/podcast/) - Good podcast I just discovered.

* [Chart of shame: The S&P 500 vs. everyone who said the market was about to crash](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-road-to-fresh-stock-market-highs-is-littered-with-these-awful-correction-calls-2018-08-28) - A good chart that shows why you should ignore predictions for a market crash. There will be a major drop at some point but good luck trying to predict exactly when it will happen.

* [Why Is Behavioral Economics So Popular?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/opinion/sunday/behavioral-economics.html)
