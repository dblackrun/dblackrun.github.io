Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Why don't we get the news we need?](https://vicki.substack.com/p/why-dont-we-get-the-news-we-need)

* [Poverty isn’t a lack of character. It’s a lack of cash](https://thecorrespondent.com/283/poverty-isnt-a-lack-of-character-its-a-lack-of-cash/37442933638-a4773584) - "Compare it to a new computer that’s running 10 heavy programmes at once. It gets slower and slower, makes errors, and eventually freezes – not because it’s a bad computer but because it has to do too much at once. Poor people have an analogous problem. They’re making bad decisions not because they are stupid but because they’re living in a context in which anyone would make bad decisions."

* [The rise of tribal subscription marketing](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2020/02/13/the-rise-of-tribal-subscription-marketing/)
