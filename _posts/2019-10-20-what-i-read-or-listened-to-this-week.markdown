Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [How A Massive Facebook Scam Siphoned Millions Of Dollars From Unsuspecting Boomers](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-subscription-trap-free-trial-scam-ads-inc) - "If a Facebook ad reviewer were to click the link, they would likely be taken to a “safe page,” often a hastily thrown-together food blog. But the average person would be taken to a different page engineered to make them hand over their credit card number."

* [Practical Advice for “Imposter Syndrome”](https://medium.com/@hspter/practical-advice-for-imposter-syndrome-120586c30d6b)

* [The Happiness Lab](https://www.happinesslab.fm/)

* [Facebook isn’t free speech, it’s algorithmic amplification optimized for outrage](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/20/facebook-isnt-free-speech-its-algorithmic-amplification-optimized-for-outrage/) - "As we’ve all seen, “optimizing for engagement” all too often means optimizing for outrage, for polarization, for disingenuous misinformation. True, it doesn’t mean favoring any side of any given issue; but it does mean favoring the extremes, the conspiracy theorists, the histrionic diatribes on all sides. It means fomenting mistrust, suspicion, and conflict everywhere."
