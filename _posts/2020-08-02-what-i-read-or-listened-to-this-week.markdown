Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [If you’re not terrified about Facebook, you haven’t been paying attention](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/26/with-facebook-we-are-already-through-the-looking-glass)

* [You Are Not So Smart 185 - Masks](https://soundcloud.com/youarenotsosmart/185-masks)

* [Economics is a disgrace](http://macromomblog.com/2020/07/29/economics-is-a-disgrace/) - "Elite departments are the gatekeepers of the economics profession. They circle wagons around other elites. MIT, Harvard, and Chicago define what is good research. They run two of the top five journals that many elite departments require for tenure. They decide what is cutting-edge research. They decide who gets the top honors in the profession. For decades, research on race and gender, as well as work using feminist or alternate frameworks were rejected. The gatekeepers passed leadership to their students at elite universities. Many MIT and Harvard students are automatic members of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Economists outside elite circles are not seen as top researchers; they are not voted in as members of the NBER; they are not invited to give seminars at elite departments; and they are not on AEA Exec. A handful of departments run economics. They maintain an exclusive culture."

* [Our Educational Colonialism](https://americancompass.org/our-educational-colonialism/)

* [Good To Go](https://www.goodtogobook.com/)

* [Whistleblower](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/585732/whistleblower-by-susan-fowler/)
