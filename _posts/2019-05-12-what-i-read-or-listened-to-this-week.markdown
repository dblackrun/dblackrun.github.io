Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [IT runs on Java 8](https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/05/10/java8/) - "What I’m worried about is that places like Hacker News, r/programming, the tech press, and conferences expose us to a number of tech-forward biases about our industry that are overenthusiastic about the promises of new technology without talking about tradeoffs. That the loudest voices get the most credibility, and, that, as a result, we are listening to complicated set-ups and overengineering systems of distributed networking and queues and serverless and microservices and machine learning platforms that our companies don’t need, and that most other developers that pick up our work can’t relate to, or can even work with."

* [The Surprising, Infuriating Power of Overconfidence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/neuronarrative/201410/the-surprising-infuriating-power-overconfidence) - This is why you shouldn't pay much attention to "experts" who appear on television. Most of them are there because they speak confidently not because they know what they are talking about.

* [Not a Scientist: How Politicians Mistake, Misrepresent, and Utterly Mangle Science](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Scientist-Politicians-Mistake-Misrepresent/dp/039335332X/)
