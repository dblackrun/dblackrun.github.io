Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Best Reason for Your City to Ban Facial Recognition](https://onezero.medium.com/the-best-reason-for-your-city-to-ban-facial-recognition-d2c1f9ca094b)

* [A Multimillion-Dollar Startup Hid A Sexual Harassment Incident By Its CEO — Then A Community of Outsiders Dragged It Into the Light](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup) - "the perception of accountability is more important than accountability itself"

* [Inside the mysteries and missteps of Toronto’s smart-city dream](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-inside-the-mysteries-and-missteps-of-torontos-smart-city-dream/) - Whenever I see the term "smart city" all I think is mass surveillance.

* [Will Scootermania End With A Crash?](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/05/14/723003882/will-scootermania-end-with-a-crash) - "If motorized scooters are replacing cars, then it's clearly a win. But they may be mainly replacing biking and walking, which makes them a loss." They definitely aren't replacing cars here.
