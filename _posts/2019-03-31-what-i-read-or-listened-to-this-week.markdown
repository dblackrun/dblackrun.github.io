Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [How malevolent machine learning could derail AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613170/emtech-digital-dawn-song-adversarial-machine-learning/) - "Another project involved modifying road signs with a few innocuous-looking stickers to fool the computer vision systems used in many vehicles. In a video demo, Song showed how the car could be tricked into thinking that a stop sign actually says the speed limit is 45 miles per hour. This could be a huge problem for an automated driving system that relies on such information."

* [The Paradox of Employee Surveillance](http://behavioralscientist.org/the-paradox-of-employee-surveillance/) - "Research suggests that when companies monitor an employeeâ€™s every move, they signal distrust, which can lead to employee disengagement. Disengaged employees are less productive; they can also introduce new risks to the organization as people stop actively searching for the right thing to do and focus instead on mere compliance."

* [The Hidden Costs of Reminders](http://behavioralscientist.org/the-hidden-costs-of-reminders/)
