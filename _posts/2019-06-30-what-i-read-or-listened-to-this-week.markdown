Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The BS-Industrial Complex of Phony A.I.](https://gen.medium.com/the-bs-industrial-complex-of-phony-a-i-44bf1c0c60f8) - "If our senators couldn’t understand that Facebook makes money through selling advertising, how can we ever hope they’ll understand the technical realities and limitations of A.I.? With potentially tens of millions of jobs in the balance, “A.I.” will become whatever the highest paid lobbying firm convinces our politicians it is."

* [Facts Don’t Change People’s Minds. Here’s What Does](https://heleo.com/facts-dont-change-peoples-minds-heres/16242/) - "The moment you belittle the mind for believing in something, you’ve lost the battle. At that point, the mind will dig in rather than give in. Once you’ve equated someone’s beliefs with idiocracy, changing that person’s mind will require nothing short of an admission that they are unintelligent. And that’s an admission that most minds aren’t willing to make."

* [YANSS 155 – What we can learn about why we dangerously disagree on the truth from The Dress, Yanny, and bloie, presented live in New York at The Bell House](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2019/06/06/yanss-155-what-we-can-learn-about-why-we-dangerously-disagree-on-the-truth-from-the-dress-yanny-and-bloie-presented-live-in-new-york-at-the-bell-house/)
