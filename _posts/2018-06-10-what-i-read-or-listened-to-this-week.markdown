Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [GitHub Is Microsoft’s $7.5 Billion Undo Button](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/github-is-microsoft-s-7-5-billion-undo-button) - There are a lot of opinions on whether Microsoft buying GitHub will be good or bad for programmers. That speaks to how important GitHub is.

* [In Praise of Extreme Moderation](https://hbr.org/2018/06/in-praise-of-extreme-moderation)

* [Why Rich Kids Are So Good at the Marshmallow Test](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/marshmallow-test/561779/) - "Ultimately, the new study finds limited support for the idea that being able to delay gratification leads to better outcomes. Instead, it suggests that the capacity to hold out for a second marshmallow is shaped in large part by a child’s social and economic background—and, in turn, that that background, not the ability to delay gratification, is what’s behind kids’ long-term success."

* [Why you need to improve your training data, and how to do it](https://petewarden.com/2018/05/28/why-you-need-to-improve-your-training-data-and-how-to-do-it/) - Tinkering with model parameters and feature sets can only improve things so much. To see big improvements you should look for ways to improve your training data. "If you’re answering the wrong question with your model, you’ll never be able to build a solid user experience on that poor foundation."

* [What We Learned By Failing to Make Work Better for Female Staff](http://behavioralscientist.org/what-we-learned-by-failing-to-make-work-better-for-female-staff/) - " Trainings are mostly ineffective at changing behavior and can even backfire, especially when trainings are mandatory and participants resent being sent to the course"
