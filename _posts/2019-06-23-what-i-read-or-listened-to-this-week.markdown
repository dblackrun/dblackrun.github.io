Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Most Popular Kids’ Video Site in the World Isn’t for Kids](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-17/the-most-popular-kids-video-site-in-the-world-isn-t-for-kids) - "Four people at Google privately admitted that they don’t let their kids watch YouTube unsupervised and said the sentiment was widespread at the company. One of these people said frustration with YouTube has grown so much that some have suggested the division spin off altogether to preserve Google’s brand."

* [Think Chernobyl Can't Happen in the West? It Already Has](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/06/think-chernobyl-cant-happen-in-the-west-it-already.html) - "But we shouldn’t be smug, as we’re currently on a path that will lead to future historians making the exact same conclusions about us."

* [Goodbye, Chrome: Google’s web browser has become spy software](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/) - "It turns out, having the world’s biggest advertising company make the most popular Web browser was about as smart as letting kids run a candy shop." It would be nice if the article mentioned how many trackers are on the Washington Post site.

* [I’m a Journalist but I Didn’t Fully Realize the Terrible Power of U.S. Border Officials Until They Violated My Rights and Privacy](https://theintercept.com/2019/06/22/cbp-border-searches-journalists/) - "CBP can search any person’s device, at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all. If you refuse to give up your password, CBP’s policy is to seize the device."
