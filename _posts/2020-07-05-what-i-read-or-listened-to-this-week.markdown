Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [How Citizen Journalism & Education Reform Can Save Us from Bad Science](https://liora.substack.com/p/how-citizen-journalism-and-education)

* [Why Economics Needs More Black Women](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-economics-needs-more-black-women/) - "The exposure that people get in intro to econ classes is to consider “all things equal,” assuming racism doesn’t exist and society is perfect. That’s what people are trained on. We need a more nuanced approach. We need a diversity of thought in economics as it relates to appreciating interdisciplinary research and also looking at behavioral economics. And not thinking of these as watered down versions of economics. That’s another problem. The ones who are upholding these systems are so particular, and they call it being “rigorous.”"

* [Good things don't scale](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2017/05/10/good-things-don't-scale/)
