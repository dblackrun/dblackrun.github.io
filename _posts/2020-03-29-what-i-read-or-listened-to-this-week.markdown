Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Using Zoom? Here are the privacy issues you need to be aware of](https://protonmail.com/blog/zoom-privacy-issues/)

* [A Failure of Systemic Thinking](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/03/what-really-doomed-americas-coronavirus-response/608596/) - "We faltered because of our failure to consider risk in its full context, especially when dealing with coupled risk—when multiple things can go wrong together. We were hampered by our inability to think about second- and third-order effects and by our susceptibility to scientism—the false comfort of assuming that numbers and percentages give us a solid empirical basis. We failed to understand that complex systems defy simplistic reductionism."

* [Any port in a storm, as long as it has facemasks](https://vicki.substack.com/p/any-port-in-a-storm-as-long-as-it)
