Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [For the good of all humankind, make your city more walkable](https://qz.com/1421323/for-the-good-of-all-humankind-make-your-city-more-walkable/)

* [When courtroom science goes wrong — and how stats can fix it](https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2018/when-courtroom-science-goes-wrong-and-how-stats-can-fix-it) - A really well done comic.

* [Statscan may be dull, but it’s a vital institution](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-statscan-may-be-dull-but-its-a-vital-institution/) - "For decades, Statistics Canada has been taken for granted. As the country and the world became bigger and more complex, the agency was underfunded and could not keep up. Experts in many fields have long complained that its output is sparse, patchy and slow. Merely making up lost ground would require major investment. Recognizing the threat of truth decay, and the indispensable role Statscan could play in fighting it, would multiply the cost. But democracy is worth it."

* [The Study Premortem: Why Publishing Null Results Is Only the First Step](http://behavioralscientist.org/the-study-premortem-why-publishing-null-results-is-only-the-first-step/)
