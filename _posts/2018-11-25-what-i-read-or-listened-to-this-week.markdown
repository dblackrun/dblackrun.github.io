Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [You Are Not So Smart Podcast - Not A Scientist](https://soundcloud.com/youarenotsosmart/141-not-a-scientist) - You often hear politicians say "I'm not a scientist but ..." as a way to get around saying something ignorant. Why do we never hear them do the same about economics, tax policy or many other topics where they aren't knowledgeable? The easiest way to get people to go against the established science is to come up with an explanation that is really simple (that's probably wrong) that gets an emotional response.

* [‘Nothing on this page is real’: How lies become truth in online America](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/nothing-on-this-page-is-real-how-lies-become-truth-in-online-america/2018/11/17/edd44cc8-e85a-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html)

* [You Snooze, You Lose: Insurers Make The Old Adage Literally True](https://www.propublica.org/article/you-snooze-you-lose-insurers-make-the-old-adage-literally-true) - Another example of companies spying on you to exploit you without your knowledge.
