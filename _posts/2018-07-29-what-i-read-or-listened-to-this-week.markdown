* [Messing with the Enemy: Surviving in a Social Media World of Hackers, Terrorists, Russians, and Fake News](https://www.amazon.com/Messing-Enemy-Surviving-Terrorists-Russians/dp/0062795988) - Good read on the history of using the internet and social media as a tool of influence from al-Qaeda's use in the early days of the internet to the rise of ISIS to the current active measures used by Russia. It also includes some tips on how not to get fooled by fake news.
