Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Media Needs to Stop Inspiring Copycat Murders. Here's How.](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/266439/)

* [How the Rich Really Play, “Who Wants To Be An Ivy Leaguer?”](https://www.propublica.org/article/college-admission-bribe-rich-parents-ivy-league-how-to)

* [YouTube’s Recommendation Algorithm Has a Dark Side](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/youtubes-recommendation-algorithm-has-a-dark-side/) - "YouTube's algorithms will push whatever they deem engaging, and it appears they have figured out that wild claims, as well as hate speech and outrage peddling, can be particularly so."

* [Documentary: Millennials & Debt | No Room to Maneuver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53GiUoEeIvA&feature=youtu.be)
