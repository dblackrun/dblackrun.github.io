Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Amy Webb on Artificial Intelligence, Humanity, and the Big Nine](http://www.econtalk.org/amy-webb-on-artificial-intelligence-humanity-and-the-big-nine/)

* [The Modern Trap of Turning Hobbies Into Hustles](https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/02/trap-of-turning-hobbies-into-hustles.html) - "We don’t have to monetize or optimize or organize our joy. Hobbies don’t have to be imbued with a purpose beyond our own enjoyment of them. They, alone, can be enough."

* [YANSS 149 – Expert advice on how health experts can better provide good health advice to combat bad health advice from non-experts](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2019/03/11/yanss-149-expert-advice-on-how-health-experts-can-better-provide-good-health-advice-to-combat-bad-health-advice-from-non-experts/)
