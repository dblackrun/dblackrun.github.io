Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [All numbers are made up, some are useful](https://vicki.substack.com/p/all-numbers-are-made-up-some-are) - "The point is that, whatever data you dig into, at any given point in time, that looks solid on the surface, will be a complete mess underneath, plagued by undefined values, faulty studies, small sample problems, plagiarism, and all of the rest of the beautiful mess that is human life."

* [Social Distancing: This is Not a Snow Day](https://medium.com/@ariadnelabs/social-distancing-this-is-not-a-snow-day-ac21d7fa78b4)

* [To Solve Problems Before They Happen, You Need to Unite the Right People](https://behavioralscientist.org/dan-heath-iceland-drinking-to-solve-problems-before-they-happen-you-need-to-unite-the-right-people-upstream/)
