Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [How to Teach Artificial Intelligence Some Common Sense](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-teach-artificial-intelligence-common-sense/)

* [You Realize The Olympics Don’t Have To Exist, Right?](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/end-the-olympics-pyeongchang-rio-de-janeiro_us_5ba54ecae4b0375f8f9cd97e)

* [I Found the Best Burger Place in America. And Then I Killed It.](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/portland/stanichs-closed-will-it-reopen-burger-quest)

* [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/) - I read this book several years ago and just read it again. One thing I did notice this time through was some of the studies mentioned in the book are ones that I have read about being not reproducible.

* [Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html) - How anyone could trust Facebook at this point is mind boggling to me.
