Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Episode 94: The Goofy Pseudoscience Copaganda of TV Forensics](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-94-the-goofy-pseudoscience-copaganda-of-tv-forensics) - I knew most of the forensic techniques used in court are bogus science, but I hadn't considered the impact TV shows could have on leading people, many of whom end up on juries, to believe they are legit.

* [Reactions to Political Correctness Are Not Inherently Partisan](https://behavioralscientist.org/reactions-to-political-correctness-are-not-inherently-partisan/) - "Politically incorrect communicators may appear more authentic and certain in their views, but our preliminary evidence suggests they are also less effective in persuading, and engaging with, those who may have different beliefs from them."

* [Introducing Culdesac: Building car-free neighborhoods from scratch](https://medium.com/culdesac/introducing-culdesac-3fbfe7c4219c)

* [I was a drug rep. I know how pharma companies pushed opioids.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/i-was-a-drug-rep-i-know-how-pharma-companies-pushed-opioids/2019/11/25/82b1da88-beb9-11e9-9b73-fd3c65ef8f9c_story.html) - "Private health information companies compiled this treasure trove of data using records bought from pharmacies. Such databases, which have only grown bigger and more sophisticated in recent years, were essential to opioid sales: Drug companies could easily target the most frequent prescribers in a Zip code, zeroing in on the doctors who saw many chronic-pain patients at their practices â€” or who were just freer with their prescription pads"
