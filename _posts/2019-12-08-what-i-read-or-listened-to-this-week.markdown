Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [The Smartest Guys in the Clubhouse](https://newrepublic.com/article/155863/houston-astros-cheaters-2017-world-series-mckinsey-problem) - "It is striking, but not really surprising, that all this well-credentialed cleverness and machine-tooled efficiency tends to deliver the same solution, which amounts to more for the client and less for everyone else; that is the goal, after all."

* [Algorithms were supposed to make Virginia judges fairer. What happened was far more complicated.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/19/algorithms-were-supposed-make-virginia-judges-more-fair-what-actually-happened-was-far-more-complicated/)

* [How is WAR calculated, really? Breaking down a single play to find out](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28210701/how-war-calculated-really-breaking-single-play-find-out)

* [Don’t Learn to Code — Learn to Automate](https://daedtech.com/dont-learn-to-code-learn-to-automate/)
