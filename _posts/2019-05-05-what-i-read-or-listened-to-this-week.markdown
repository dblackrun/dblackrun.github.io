Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Canada’s new far right: A trove of private chat room messages reveals an extremist subculture](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadas-new-far-right-a-trove-of-private-chat-room-messages-reveals/)

* [Think You’re Discreet Online? Think Again](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/opinion/computational-inference.html) - "Such tools are already being marketed for use in hiring employees, for detecting shoppers’ moods and predicting criminal behavior. Unless they are properly regulated, in the near future we could be hired, fired, granted or denied insurance, accepted to or rejected from college, rented housing and extended or denied credit based on facts that are inferred about us. This is worrisome enough when it involves correct inferences. But because computational inference is a statistical technique, it also often gets things wrong — and it is hard, and perhaps impossible, to pinpoint the source of the error, for these algorithms offer little to no insights into how they operate. What happens when someone is denied a job on the basis of an inference that we aren’t even sure is correct? "

* [The Truth About Dentistry](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/the-trouble-with-dentistry/586039/)
