Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Glitch Capitalism: How Cheating AIs Explain Our Glitchy Society](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/04/malcolm-harris-on-glitch-capitalism-and-ai-logic.html) - When you train a machine learning model, sometimes it comes up with a model that solves the problem by finding a loop hole that doesn't really solve the problem.

* [Endure](https://www.amazon.com/Endure-Curiously-Elastic-Limits-Performance/dp/0062499866/) - A book by [Alex Hutchinson](https://twitter.com/sweatscience), a former national level distance runner in Canada, on pushing the limits of human performance. If you have competed in endurance sports you probably have an idea how much of a role the mind plays in high level performance. This book details several different ways the mind can impact your body's limits.  It does a good job explaining scientific studies with storytelling, using examples of how endurance athletes are applying them in practice. If you have an interest in endurance sports, you will enjoy this book.

* [Qualitative before Quantitative: How Qualitative Methods Support Better Data Science](https://medium.com/indeed-data-science/qualitative-before-quantitative-how-qualitative-methods-support-better-data-science-d2b01d0c4e64) - Qualitative methods can help you come up with features for your model you may not have considered otherwise.

* [The Value of Failing](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/04/the-value-of-failing/558848/) - There is a lot of value in learning from failure. It's good to see more research being done on it.

* [Why we should bulldoze the business school](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/bulldoze-the-business-school) - A business school teacher thinks we should shut down business schools. This paragraph stood out to me "If we educate our graduates in the inevitability of tooth-and-claw capitalism, it is hardly surprising that we end up with justifications for massive salary payments to people who take huge risks with other peopleâ€™s money. If we teach that there is nothing else below the bottom line, then ideas about sustainability, diversity, responsibility and so on become mere decoration. The message that management research and teaching often provides is that capitalism is inevitable, and that the financial and legal techniques for running capitalism are a form of science. This combination of ideology and technocracy is what has made the business school into such an effective, and dangerous, institution."
