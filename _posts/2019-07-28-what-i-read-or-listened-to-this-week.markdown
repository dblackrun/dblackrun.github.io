Here is some non-basketball content I read or listened to this week that I found interesting:


* [Chris Arnade on Dignity](http://www.econtalk.org/chris-arnade-on-dignity/)

* [ESPN Backs Itself Into a Corner](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/dan-le-batard-shows-why-espn-cant-ban-politics/594820/) - "ESPN clearly believes in the notion that sports should be a refuge for fans. But unfortunately, sports don’t take place in some alternate universe where real problems can’t interfere. The only people who comfortably pretend sports is just an escape are those who don’t have to worry about being told to go back to where they came from."

* [Chances are, you’re not as open-minded as you think](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/chances-are-youre-not-as-open-minded-as-you-think/2019/07/20/0319d308-aa4f-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html) - "Science-curious folk always chose to look at new evidence, whether it aligned with their beliefs or not. Less science-curious adults became more resistant to contrary evidence and more politically polarized as they gained subject matter knowledge."

* ['Anonymised' data can never be totally anonymous, says study](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/anonymised-data-never-be-anonymous-enough-study-finds)
